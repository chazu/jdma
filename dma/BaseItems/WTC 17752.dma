  "Just as with weapons, you can purchase or craft masterwork versions of armor
  or shields. Such a well-made item functions like the normal version, except
  that its armor check penalty is lessened by 1.

  A masterwork suit of armor or shield costs an extra 150 gp over and above the
  normal cost for that type of armor or shield.

  The masterwork quality of a suite of armor never provides a bonus on attack
  or damage rolls, even if the armor or shield is used as a weapon (such as
  \Item{spiked armor} or a \Item{spiked shield}).

  All magic armors and shields are automatically considered to be of masterwork
  quality.

  You can't add the masterwork quality to armor or a shield after it is
  created; it must be created as a masterwork item.";

  "A masterwork weapon is a finely crafted version of a normal weapon. Wielding
   it provides a +1 enhancement bonus on attack rolls.

  You can't add the masterwork quality to a weapon after it is created; it must
  be crafted as a masterwork weapon (see the Craft skill, page 70). The
  masterwork quality adds 300 gp to the cost of a normal weapon. For example, a
  masterwork bastard sword costs 335 gp.

  All magic weapons are automatically considered to be of masterwork
  quality. The enhancement bonus granted by the masterwork quality doesn't
  stack with the enhancement bonus provided by the weapon's magic.

  Even though some types of armor and shields (such as spiked shields) can be
  used as weapons, you can't create a masterwork version of such an item that
  confers an enhancement bonus on attack rolls. Instead, masterwork armor and
  shields have lessened armor check penalties (see Masterwork Armor, page
  126).";

  description "This dreaded rod is a bane to magic items, for its touch drains an item of all magical properties. The item touched must make a DC 23 Will save to prevent the rod from draining it. If a creature is holding it at the time, then the item can use the holder’s Will save bonus in place of its own if the holder’s is better. In such cases, contact is made by making a melee touch attack roll. Upon draining an item, the rod itself becomes brittle and cannot be used again. Drained items are only restorable by wish or miracle. (If a sphere of annihilation and a rod of cancellation negate each other, nothing can restore either of them.)";

  "Constructed of iron set with silver rivets, this rod has the properties of a
  +2 light mace. Its other magi- cal powers are as follows.

  list {\bold{Thunder:} Once per day, the rod can strike as a +3 light mace,
  and the opponent struck is stunned from the noise of the rodâs impact
  (Fortitude DC 16 negates). Activating this power counts as a free action, and
  it works if the wielder strikes an opponent within 1 round.}

  {\bold{Lightning:} Once per day, when the wielder desires, a short spark of
  electricity can leap forth when the rod strikes an opponent to deal the
  normal damage for a +2 light mace (1d6+2) and an extra 2d6 points of
  electricity damage. Even when the rod might not score a normal hit in combat,
  if the roll was good enough to count as a successful melee touch attack hit,
  then the 2d6 points of electricity damage still applies. The wielder
  activates this power as a free action, and it works if he strikes an opponent
  within 1 round.}

  {\bold{Thunderclap:} Once per day as a standard action, the wielder can cause
  the rod to give out a deafening noise, just as a shoutspell (Fortitude DC 16
  partial, 2d6 points of sonic damage, target deafened for 2d6 rounds).}

  {\bold{Lightning Stroke} Once per day as a standard action, the wielder can
  cause the rod to shoot out a 5-foot-wide lightning bolt (9d6 points of
  electricity damage, Reflex DC 16 half) to a range of 200 feet.}

  \bold{Thunder and Lightning:} Once per week as a standard action, the wielder
  of the rod can combine the thunderclap described above with a lightning bolt,
  as in the lightning stroke. The thunderclap affects all within 10 feet of the
  bolt. The lightning strokedeals 9d6 points of electricity damage (count rolls
  of 1 or 2 as rolls of 3, for a range of 27 to 54 points), and the
  thunderclap deals 2d6 points of sonic damage. A single DC 16 Reflex save
  applies for both effects.".

  "A scroll is a heavy sheet of fine vellum or high-quality paper. An area the
  size of a piece of modern-day notebook paper (about \frac[8]{1}{2} inches
  wide and 11 inches long) is sufficient to hold one spell. The sheet is
  reinforced at the top and bottom with stripes of leather slightly longer than
  the sheet is wide. A scroll holding more than one spell has the same width
  (about \frac[8]{1}{2} inches) but is an extra foot or so long for each extra
  spell. Scrolls that hold three or more spells are usually fitted with
  reinforcing rods at each end rather than simple stirps of leather. A scroll
  as AC 9, 1 hit point, harness 0, and a break DC of 8.

  To protect it from wrinkling or tearing, a scroll is rolled up from both ends
  to form a double cylinder. (This also helps the user unroll the scroll
  quickly.) The scroll is placed in a tube of ivory, jade, leather, metal, or
  wood. Most scroll cases are inscribed with magic symbols (see \Spell{Arcane
  Mark}). The symbols often hide magic traps such as \Spell{Glyph of Warding}
  or \Spell{Fire Trap} spells.";

  \Item{bag of holding} and can actually hold material as much as 2 cubic feet
  in volume or 20 pounds in weight. The large central portion can contain up to
  8 cubic feet or 80 pounds of material. Even when so filled, the backpack
  always weighs only 5 pounds.

  While such storage is useful enough, the pack has an even greater power in
  addition. When the wearer reaches into it for a specific item, that item is
  always on top. Thus, no digging around and fumbling is ever necessary to find
  what a haversack contains. Retrieving any specific item from a haversack is a

  retrieving a stored item usually does.";

  "This device appears to be nothing but beads on a string, sometimes with the
  ends tied together to form a necklace. (It does not count as an item worn
  around the neck for the purpose of determining which of a character's worn
  magic items is effective.) If a character holds it, however, all can see the
  strand as it really is'a golden chain from which hang a number of golden
  spheres. The spheres are detachable by the wearer (and only by the wearer),
  who can easily hurl one of them up to 70 feet. When a sphere arrives at the
  end of its trajectory, it detonates as a \Spell{fireball} spell (Reflex DC 14
  half).  Spheres come in different strengths, ranging from those that deal 2d6
  points of fire damage to those that deal 10d6.

  If the necklace is being worn or carried by a character who fails her saving
  throw against a magical fire attack, the item must make a saving throw as
  well (with a save bonus of +7). If the necklace fails to save, all its
  remaining spheres detonate simultaneously, often with regrettable
  consequences for the wearer.".

  make claw attacks that deal 1d10 points of damage, strike as +1 weapons, and
  afflict the target as if she had been struck by a \SpellRef{contagion} spell
  (Fortitude DC 14 negates). Use of contagion requires a normal melee attack
  with the claws. The “claws” are built into the armor’s vambraces and
  gauntlets.  The armor bestows one negative level on any nonevil creature
  wearing it. This negative level persists as long as the armor is worn and
  disappears when the armor is removed.

  The negative level never results in actual level loss, but it cannot be
  overcome in any way (including restoration spells) while the armor is worn.".

  the rod’s wielder. In this case, only the feats possessed by the wielder
  adjust the spell slot of the spell being cast.

  Possession of a metamagic rod does not confer the associated feat on the
  owner, only the ability to use the given feat a specified number of times per
  day. A sorcerer still must take a full-round action when using a metamagic
  rod, just as if using a metamagic feat he possesses.

  there is a 1-round delay. The piper must continue playing until the rats
  appear, and when they do so, the piper must make a DC 10 Perform (wind
  instruments) check. Success means that they obey the piperâs telepathic
  commands so long as he continues to play. Failure indicates that they turn on
  the piper. If for any reason the piper ceases playing, the rats leave
  immediately. If they are called again within a day, the Perform check DC is
  15.

  If the rats are under the control of another creature, add the HD of the
  controller to the Perform check DC. Once control is assumed, another check
  is required each round to maintain it if the other creature is actively
