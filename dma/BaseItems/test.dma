  "Alchemist's fire is sticky, adhesive substance that ignites when exposed to
  air. You can throw a flask of alchemist's fire as a splash weapon (see Throw
  Splash Weapon, page 158 in the \Product[WTC 17524]{Player's Handbook}). Treat
  this attack as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet.  A
  direct hit deals 1d6 points of fire damage. Every creature within 5 feet of
  the point where the flask hits takes 1 point of fire damage from the
  splash. On the round following a direct hit, the target takes an additional
  1d6 points of damage. If desired, the target can use a full-round action to
  attempt to extinguish the flames before taking this additional
  damage. Extinguishing the flames requires a DC 15 Reflex save. Rolling on the
  ground provides the target a +2 bonus on the save. Leaping into a lake or
  magically extinguishing the flames automatically smothers the fire.";
