  "This round leather bag is full of alchemical goo.  When you throw a
  tanglefoot bag at a creature (as a ranged touch attack with a range increment
  of 10 feet), the bag comes apart and the goo bursts out, entangling the
  target and then becoming tough and resilient upon exposure to air. An
  entangled creature takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls and a
  -4 penalty to Dexterity and must make a DC 15 Reflex save or be glued
  to the floor, unable to move. Even on a successful save, it can move only at
  half speed. Huge or larger creatures are unaffected by a tanglefoot bag. A
  flying creature is not stuck to the floor, but it must make a DC 15 Reflex
  save or be unable to fly (assuming it uses its wings to fly) and fall to the
  ground. A tanglefoot bag does not function underwater.  A creature that is
  glued to the floor (or unable to fly) can break free by making a DC 17
  Strength check or by dealing 15 points of damage to the goo with a slashing
  weapon. A creature trying to scrape goo off itself, or another creature
  assisting, does not need to make an attack roll; hitting the goo is
  automatic, after which the creature that hit makes a damage roll to see how
  much of the goo was scraped off. Once free, the creature can move (including
  flying) at half speed. A character capable of spellcasting who is bound by
  the goo must make a DC 15 Concentration check to cast a spell. The goo
  becomes brittle and fragile after 2d4 rounds, cracking apart and losing its
  effectiveness. An application of universal solvent (see page 268 of the
  Dungeon Master's Guide) to a stuck creature dissolves the
  alchemical goo immediately.";
