  description
  "A fang-shaped crystal dangles from a loop of finely wrought silver chain in
  the center of this spiderweb medallion. When the chain is used to wrap the
  \Item{fang scarab} around a monstrous spider's waist (the juncture of its
  cephalothorax and its abdomen), the creature can hear \God{Lolth}'s dark
  whispers in its subconscious. This gives it an instinctive knowledge of what
  the next moment will bring, which manifests as a +1 insight bonus on attack
  rolls. (This ability does not function during \God{Lolth}'s silence.

  Because the \Item{fang scarab} is designed for spiders, it's not useful to
  mose adventurers. A nonspider can make a \Item{fang scarab} function with a
  successful \Skill{Use Magic Device} check (DC 25), but doing so also fusses
  it permanently to its user's neck, near the Adam's apple. Nothing short of
  the wearer's death can then remove it.

  Thought the \Item{fang scarab} grants its wearer the same attack bonus that
  it would to a spider, it also initiates a metamorphosis that can change the
  wearer into a half-spider abomination over time. When the scarab first
  attaches itself, the wearer's canine teeth enlarge and coarse black hairs
  appear on the back of his or her neck. No further changes occur until the
  character attains levels in the \Class{fang of Lolth} prestige class (fully
  detailed in \Product{Song & Silence: A Guidebook to Rogues and Bards}).";
