  description
  "Alchemist's fire is sticky, adhesive substance that ignites when exposed to
  air. You can throw a flask of alchemist's fire as a splash weapon (see Throw
  Splash Weapon, page 158 in the \Product[WTC 17524]{Player's Handbook}). Treat
  this attack as a ranged touch attack with a range increment of 10 feet.  A
  direct hit deals 1d6 points of fire damage. Every creature within 5 feet of
  the point where the flask hits takes 1 point of fire damage from the
  splash. On the round following a direct hit, the target takes an additional
  1d6 points of damage. If desired, the target can use a full-round action to
  attempt to extinguish the flames before taking this additional
  damage. Extinguishing the flames requires a DC 15 Reflex save. Rolling on the
  ground provides the target a +2 bonus on the save. Leaping into a lake or
  magically extinguishing the flames automatically smothers the fire.";

base item with incomplete Caltrops =

  "The following aspects of the item are not yet handled by
                    jDMA. They could be handled by adding the ability to create a
                    construct with speed 0, reach 0 ft and the given attach modes.
                    Each time a creature moves into an area covered by caltrops
                    (or spends a round fighting while standing in such an area),
                    it might step on one. The caltrops make an attack roll (base
                    attack bonus +0) against the creature. For this attack, the
                    creature's shield, armor, and deflection bonuses do not
                    count. (Deflection averts blows as they approach, but it does
                    not prevent a creature from touching something dangerous.) If
                    the creature is wearing shoes or other footwear, it gets a +2
                    armor bonus to AC. If the caltrops succeed on the attack, the
                    creature has stepped on one. The caltrop deals 1 point of
                    damage, and the creature s speed is reduced by one-half
                    because its foot is wounded. This movement penalty lasts for
                    24 hours, or until the creature is successfully treated with a
                    DC 15 Heal check, or until it receives at least 1 point of
                    magical curing. A charging or running creature must
                    immediately stop if it steps on a caltrop. Any creature moving
                    at half speed or slower can pick its way through a bed of
                    caltrops with no trouble. The DM judges the effectiveness of
                    caltrops against unusual opponents. A Small monstrous
                    centipede, for example, can slither through an area containing
                    caltrops with no chance of hurting itself, and a fire giant
                    wearing fire giant-sized boots is immune to normal-size
                    caltrops. (They just get stuck in the soles of his boots.)";

  "This round leather bag is full of alchemical goo.  When you throw a
  tanglefoot bag at a creature (as a ranged touch attack with a range increment
  of 10 feet), the bag comes apart and the goo bursts out, entangling the
  target and then becoming tough and resilient upon exposure to air. An
  entangled creature takes a -2 penalty on attack rolls and a
  -4 penalty to Dexterity and must make a DC 15 Reflex save or be glued
  to the floor, unable to move. Even on a successful save, it can move only at
  half speed. Huge or larger creatures are unaffected by a tanglefoot bag. A
  flying creature is not stuck to the floor, but it must make a DC 15 Reflex
  save or be unable to fly (assuming it uses its wings to fly) and fall to the
  ground. A tanglefoot bag does not function underwater.  A creature that is
  glued to the floor (or unable to fly) can break free by making a DC 17
  Strength check or by dealing 15 points of damage to the goo with a slashing
  weapon. A creature trying to scrape goo off itself, or another creature
  assisting, does not need to make an attack roll; hitting the goo is
  automatic, after which the creature that hit makes a damage roll to see how
  much of the goo was scraped off. Once free, the creature can move (including
  flying) at half speed. A character capable of spellcasting who is bound by
  the goo must make a DC 15 Concentration check to cast a spell. The goo
  becomes brittle and fragile after 2d4 rounds, cracking apart and losing its
  effectiveness. An application of universal solvent (see page 268 of the
  Dungeon Master's Guide) to a stuck creature dissolves the
  alchemical goo immediately.";

  "A fighting net has small barbs in the weave and a trailing rope to control
  netted opponents. You use it to entangle enemies.  When you throw a net, you
  make a ranged touch attack against your target. A net's maximum range is 10
  feet. If you hit, the target is entangled. An entangled creature takes a -2
  penalty on attack rolls and a -4 penalty on Dexterity, can move at only half
  speed, and cannot charge or run. If you control the trailing rope by
  succeeding on an opposed Strength check while holding it, the entangled
  creature can move only within the limits that the rope allows. If the
  entangled creature attempts to cast a spell, it must make a DC 15
  Concentration check or be unable to cast the spell.

  An entangled creature can escape with a DC 20 Escape Artist check (a
  full-round action). The net has 5 hit points and can be burst with a DC 25
  Strength check (also a full-round action).

  A net is useful only against creatures within one size category of you. For
  instance, a Small character wielding a net can entangle Tiny, Small, or
  Medium creatures.

  A net must be folded to be thrown effectively. The first time you throw your
  net in a fight, you make a normal ranged touch attack roll. After the net is
  unfolded, you take a -4 penalty on attack rolls with it. It takes 2
  rounds for a proficient user to fold a net and twice that long for a
  nonproficient one to do so.".
