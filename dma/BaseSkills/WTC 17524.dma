#----- BLUFF (CHA) ---------------------------------------------------------

base skill Bluff =

  ability            CHA;
  check              "A Bluff check is opposed by the target’s Sense Motive
                     check. See the accompanying table for examples of
                     different kinds of bluffs and the modifier to the target’s
                     Sense Motive check for each one.  Bluff Examples Example
                     Circumstances Sense Motive Modifier The target wants to
                     believe you. –5 “These emeralds aren’t stolen. I’m just
                     desperate for coin right now, so I’m offering them to you
                     cheap.” The bluff is believable and doesn’t affect the
                     target much. +0 “I don’t know what you’re talking about,
                     sir. I’m just a simple peasant girl here for the fair.”
                     The bluff is a little hard to believe or puts the target
                     at some risk. +5 “You orcs want to fight? I’ll take you
                     all on myself. I don’t need my friends’ help. Just don’t
                     get your blood all over my new surcoat.” The bluff is hard
                     to believe or puts the target at significant risk. +10
                     “This diadem doesn’t belong to the duchess. It just looks
                     like hers. Trust me, I wouldn’t sell you jewelry that
                     would get you hanged, would I?” The bluff is way out
                     there; it’s almost too incredible to consider. +20 “You
                     might find this hard to believe, but I’m actually a
                     lammasu who’s been polymorphed into halfling form by an
                     evil sorcerer. You know we lammasu are trustworthy, so you
                     can believe me.” Favorable and unfavorable circumstances
                     weigh heavily on the outcome of a bluff. Two circumstances
                     can weigh against you: The bluff is hard to believe, or
                     the action that the target is asked to take goes against
                     its self- interest, nature, persona- lity, orders, or the
                     like. If it’s important, the DM can distinguish between a
                     bluff that fails because the target doesn’t believe it and
                     one that fails because it just asks too much of the
                     target. For instance, if the target gets a +10 bonus on
                     its Sense Motive check because the bluff demands something
                     risky, and the Sense Motive check succeeds by 10 or less,
                     then the target didn’t so much see through the bluff as
                     prove reluctant to go along with it. A target that
                     succeeds by 11 or more has seen through the bluff (and
                     would have done so even if that bluff had not entailed any
                     demand).  A successful Bluff check indicates that the
                     target reacts as you wish, at least for a short time
                     (usually 1 round or less) or believes something that you
                     want it to believe. Bluff, however, is not a suggestion
                     spell. For example, you could use bluff to put a
                     shopkeeper off guard by saying that his shoes are
                     untied. At best, such a bluff would make the shopkeeper
                     glance down at his shoes. It would not cause him to ignore
                     you and fiddle with his shoes.  A bluff requires
                     interaction between you and the target. Creatures unaware
                     of you cannot be bluffed.  Feinting in Combat: You can
                     also use Bluff to mislead an opponent in melee combat (so
                     that it can’t dodge your next attack effectively). To
                     feint, make a Bluff check opposed by your target’s Sense
                     Motive check, but in this case, the target may add its
                     base attack bonus to the roll along with any other
                     applicable modifiers. If your Bluff check result exceeds
                     this special Sense Motive check result, your target is
                     denied its Dexterity bonus to AC (if any) for the next
                     melee attack you make against it. This attack must be made
                     on or before your next turn.  Feinting in this way against
                     a nonhumanoid is difficult because it’s harder to read a
                     strange creature’s body language; you take a –4 penalty on
                     your Bluff check. Against a creature of animal
                     Intelligence (1 or 2) it’s even harder; you take a –8
                     penalty. Against a non- intelligent creature, it’s
                     impossible.  Feinting in combat does not provoke an attack
                     of opportunity.  Creating a Diversion to Hide: You can use
                     the Bluff skill to help you hide. A successful Bluff check
                     gives you the momentary diversion you need to attempt a
                     Hide check while people are aware of you.  This usage does
                     not provoke an attack of opportunity.  Delivering a Secret
                     Message: You can use Bluff to get a message across to
                     another character without others understanding it. Two
                     rogues, for example, might seem to be talking about bakery
                     goods when they’re really planning how to break into the
                     evil wizard’s laboratory. The DC is 15 for simple
                     messages, or 20 for complex messages, especially those
                     that rely on getting across new information. Failure by 4
                     or less means you can’t get the message across. Failure by
                     5 or more means that some false information has been
                     implied or inferred. Anyone listening to the exchange can
                     make a Sense Motive check opposed by the Bluff check you
                     made to transmit in order to intercept your message (see

                     something elaborate. A Bluff check made to feint in combat
                     or create a diversion to hide is a standard action. A

                     check against the DC of the slope or wall. Failure means
                     you fall from your current height and sustain the
                     appropriate falling damage. (The Dungeon Master’s Guide
                     has information on falling damage.)  Accelerated Climbing:
                     You try to climb more quickly than normal.  By accepting a
                     –5 penalty, you can move half your speed (instead of
                     one-quarter your speed).  Making Your Own Handholds and
                     Footholds: You can make your own handholds and footholds
                     by pounding pitons into a wall. Doing so takes 1 minute
                     per piton, and one piton is needed per 3 feet of
                     distance. As with any surface that offers handholds and
                     footholds, a wall with pitons in it has a DC of 15. In the
                     same way, a climber with a handaxe or similar implement
                     can cut handholds in an ice wall.  Catching Yourself When
                     Falling: It’s practically impossible to catch yourself on
                     a wall while falling. Make a Climb check (DC = wall’s DC +
                     20) to do so. It’s much easier to catch yourself on a
                     slope (DC = slope’s DC + 10).  Catching a Falling
                     Character While Climbing: If someone climbing above you or
                     adjacent to you falls, you can attempt to catch the
                     falling character if he or she is within your reach. Doing
                     so requires a successful melee touch attack against the
                     falling character (though he or she can voluntarily forego
                     any Dexterity bonus to AC if desired). If you hit, you
                     must immediately attempt a Climb check (DC = wall’s DC +
                     10). Success indicates that you catch the falling
                     character, but his or her total weight, including
                     equipment, cannot exceed your heavy load limit or you
                     automatically fall. If you fail your Climb check by 4 or
                     less, you fail to stop the character’s fall but don’t lose
                     your grip on the wall. If you fail by 5 or more, you fail
                     to stop the character’s fall and begin falling as well.";
  action             "Climbing is part of movement, so it’s generally part of a
                     move action (and may be combined with other types of
                     movement in a move action). Each move action that includes
                     any climbing requires a separate Climb check. Catching
                     yourself or another falling character doesn’t take an
                     action.";

                     speed, whichever is slower) and makes a single Climb check
                     at a –5 penalty. Such a creature retains its Dexterity
                     bonus to Armor Class (if any) while climbing, and

  check              "You must make a Concentration check whenever you might
                     potentially be distracted (by taking damage, by harsh
                     weather, and so on) while engaged in some action that
                     requires your full attention. Such actions include casting
                     a spell, concentrating on an active spell (such as detect
                     magic), directing a spell (such as spiritual weapon),
                     using a spell-like ability (such as a paladin’s remove
                     disease ability), or using a skill that would provoke an
                     attack of opportunity (such as Disable Device, Heal, Open
                     Lock, and Use Rope, among others). In general, if an
                     action wouldn’t normally provoke an attack of opportunity,
                     you need not make a Concentration check to avoid being
                     distracted.  If the Concentration check succeeds, you may
                     continue with the action as normal. If the check fails,
                     the action automatically fails and is wasted. If you were
                     in the process of casting a spell, the spell is lost (see
                     Cast a Spell, page 140). If you were concentrating on an
                     active spell, the spell ends as if you had ceased
                     concentrating on it. If you were directing a spell, the
                     direction fails but the spell remains active. If you were
                     using a spell-like ability, that use of the ability is
                     lost. A skill use also fails, and in some cases a failed
                     skill check may have other ramifications as well.  The
                     table below summarizes various types of distractions that
                     cause you to make a Concentration check. If the
                     distraction occurs while you are trying to cast a spell,
                     you must add the level of the spell you are trying to cast
                     to the appropriate Concentration DC (See Concentration,
                     page 170, for more information). If more than one type of
                     distraction is present, make a check for each one; any
                     failed Concentration check indicates that the task is not

                     earning about half your check result in gold pieces per
                     week of dedicated work. You know how to use the tools of
                     your trade, how to perform the craft’s daily tasks, how to
                     supervise untrained helpers, and how to handle common
                     problems. (Untrained laborers and assistants earn an
                     average of 1 silver piece per day.)  The basic function of
                     the Craft skill, however, is to allow you to make an item
                     of the appropriate type. The DC depends on the complexity
                     of the item to be created. The DC, your check results, and
                     the price of the item determine how long it takes to make
                     a particular item. (In the game world, is it the skill
                     level required, the time required, and the raw materials
                     required that determine an item’s price.)  In some cases,
                     the fabricate spell(page 229) can be used to achieve the
                     results of a Craft check with no actual check
                     involved. However, you must make an appropriate Craft
                     check when using the spell to make articles requiring a
                     high degree of craftsmanship (jewelry, swords, glass,
                     crystal, and so forth).  A successful Craft check related
                     to woodworking in conjunction with the casting of the
                     ironwood spell (page 246) enables you to make wooden items
                     that have the strength of steel.  When casting the spell
                     minor creation (page 253), you must suc- ceed on an
                     appropriate Craft check to make a complex item. For
                     instance, a successful Craft (bowmaking) check might be
                     required to make straight arrow shafts.  All crafts
                     require artisan’s tools (page 129) to give the best chance
                     of success. If improvised tools are used, the check is
                     made with a –2 circumstance penalty. On the other hand,
                     masterwork artisan’s tools provide a +2 circumstance bonus
                     on the check.  To determine how much time and money it
                     takes to make an item, follow these steps.  1. Find the
                     item’s price in Chapter 7: Equipment of this book or in
                     the Dungeon Master’s Guide, or have the DM set the price
                     for an item not otherwise described. Put the price in
                     silver pieces (1 gp = 10 sp).  2. Find the DC from the
                     table below, or have the DM set one.  3. Pay one-third of
                     the item’s price for the cost of raw materials.  4. Make
                     an appropriate Craft check representing one week’s
                     work. If the check succeeds, multiply your check result by
                     the DC.  If the result × the DC equals the price of the
                     item in sp, then you have completed the item. (If the
                     result × the DC equals double or triple the price of the
                     item in silver pieces, then you’ve completed the task in
                     one-half or one-third of the time. Other multiples of the
                     DC reduce the time in the same manner.) If the result ×
                     the DC doesn’t equal the price, then it represents the
                     progress you’ve made this week. Record the result and make
                     a new Craft check for the next week. Each week, you make
                     more progress until your total reaches the price of the
                     item in silver pieces.  If you fail a check by 4 or less,
                     you make no progress this week. If you fail by 5 or more,
                     you ruin half the raw materials and have to pay half the
                     original raw material cost again.  Progress by the Day:
                     You can make checks by the day instead of by the week. In
                     this case your progress (check result × DC) is in copper
                     pieces instead of silver pieces.  Creating Masterwork
                     Items: You can make a masterwork item—a weapon, suit of
                     armor, shield, or tool that conveys a bonus on its use
                     through its exceptional craftsmanship, not through being
                     magical.  To create a masterwork item, you create the
                     masterwork component as if it were a separate item in
                     addition to the standard item. The masterwork component
                     has its own price (300 gp for a weapon or 150 gp for a
                     suit of armor or a shield) and a Craft DC of 20. Once both
                     the standard component and the masterwork component are
                     completed, the masterwork item is finished. Note: The cost
                     you pay for the masterwork component is one-third of the
                     given amount, just as it is for the cost in raw materials.
                     Repairing Items: Generally, you can repair an item by
                     making checks against the same DC that it took to make the
                     item in the first place. The cost of repairing an item is
                     one-fifth of the item’s price.  When you use the Craft
                     skill to make a particular sort of item, the DC for checks

                     Ropes: Your Escape Artist check is opposed by the binder’s
                     Use Rope check. Since it’s easier to tie someone up than
                     to escape from being tied up, the binder gets a +10 bonus
                     on his or her check.  Manacles and Masterwork Manacles:
                     The DC for manacles is set by their construction.  Tight
                     Space: The DC noted on the table is for getting through a
                     space where your head fits but your shoulders don’t. If
                     the space is long, such as a chimney, the DM may call for
                     multiple checks. You can’t get through a space that your
                     head does not fit through.

                     Grappler: You can make an Escape Artist check opposed by
                     your enemy’s grapple check to get out of a grapple or out
                     of a pinned condition (so that you’re only grappling). See

                     Handle an Animal: This task involves commanding an animal
                     to perform a task or trick that it knows. For instance, to
                     command a trained attack dog to attack a foe requires a DC
                     10 Handle Animal check. If the animal is wounded or has
                     taken any nonlethal damage or ability score damage, the DC
                     increases by 2. If your check succeeds, the animal
                     performs the task or trick on its next action.  “Push” an
                     Animal: To push an animal means to get it to perform a
                     task or trick that it doesn’t know but is physically
                     capable of per- forming. This category also covers making
                     an animal perform a forced march or forcing it to hustle
                     for more than 1 hour between sleep cycles (see Chapter 9:
                     Adventuring). If the animal is wounded or has taken any
                     nonlethal damage or ability score damage, the DC increases
                     by 2. If your check succeeds, the animal performs the task
                     or trick on its next action.  Teach an Animal a Trick: You
                     can teach an animal a specific trick with one week of work
                     and a successful Handle Animal check against the indicated
                     DC. An animal with an Intelligence score of 1 (such as a
                     snake or a shark) can learn a maximum of three tricks,
                     while an animal with an Intelligence score of 2 (such as a
                     dog or a horse) can learn a maximum of six
                     tricks. Possible tricks (and their associated DCs)
                     include, but are not necessarily limited to, the
                     following.  Attack (DC 20): The animal attacks apparent
                     enemies. You may point to a particular creature that you
                     wish the animal to attack, and it will comply if
                     able. Normally, an animal will attack only humanoids,
                     monstrous humanoids, giants, or other animals.  Teaching
                     an animal to attack all creatures (including such
                     unnatural creatures as undead and aberrations) counts as
                     two tricks.  Come (DC 15): The animal comes to you, even
                     if it normally would not do so (following you onto a boat,
                     for example).  Defend (DC 20): The animal defends you (or
                     is ready to defend you if no threat is present), even
                     without any command being given.  Alternatively, you can
                     command the animal to defend a specific other character.
                     Down (DC 15): The animal breaks off from combat or
                     otherwise backs down. An animal that doesn’t know this
                     trick continues to fight until it must flee (due to
                     injury, a fear effect, or the like) or its opponent is
                     defeated.  Fetch (DC 15): The animal goes and gets
                     something. If you do not point out a specific item, the
                     animal fetches some random object.  Guard (DC 20): The
                     animal stays in place and prevents others from
                     approaching.  Heel (DC 15): The animal follows you
                     closely, even to places where it normally wouldn’t go.
                     Perform (DC 15): The animal performs a variety of simple
                     tricks, such as sitting up, rolling over, roaring or
                     barking, and so on.  Seek (DC 15): The animal moves into
                     an area and looks around for anything that is obviously
                     alive or animate.  Stay (DC 15): The animal stays in
                     place, waiting for you to return. It does not challenge
                     other creatures that come by, though it still defends
                     itself if it needs to.  Track (DC 20): The animal tracks
                     the scent presented to it. (This requires the animal to
                     have the scent ability; see the Monster Manual for
                     details.)  Work (DC 15): The animal pulls or pushes a
                     medium or heavy load.  Train an Animal for a Purpose:
                     Rather than teaching an animal individual tricks, you can
                     simply train it for a general purpose. Essentially, an
                     animal’s purpose represents a preselected set of known
                     tricks that fit into a common scheme, such as guarding or
                     heavy labor. The animal must meet all the normal
                     prerequisites for all tricks included in the training
                     package. If the package includes more than three tricks,
                     the animal must have an Intelligence score of 2.  An
                     animal can be trained for only one general purpose, though
                     if the creature is capable of learning additional tricks
                     (above and beyond those included in its general purpose),
                     it may do so. Training an animal for a purpose requires
                     fewer checks than teaching individual tricks does, but no
                     less time. At your DM’s option, you may be able to train
                     an animal for a purpose that isn’t mentioned here.  Combat
                     Riding (DC 20): An animal trained to bear a rider into
                     combat knows the tricks attack, come, defend, down, guard,
                     and heel. Training an animal for combat riding takes six
                     weeks. You may also “upgrade” an animal trained for riding
                     to one trained for combat riding by spending three weeks
                     and making a successful DC 20 Handle Animal check. The new
                     general purpose and tricks completely replace the animal’s
                     previous purpose and any tricks it once knew. Warhorses
                     and riding dogs (see the Monster Manual) are already
                     trained to bear riders into combat, and they don’t require
                     any additional training for this purpose.  Fighting (DC
                     20): An animal trained to engage in combat knows the
                     tricks attack, down, and stay. Training an animal for
                     fighting takes three weeks.  Guarding (DC 20): An animal
                     trained to guard knows the tricks attack, defend, down,
                     and guard. Training an animal for guarding takes four
                     weeks.  Heavy Labor (DC 15): An animal trained for heavy
                     labor knows the tricks come and work. Training an animal
                     for heavy labor takes two weeks.  Hunting (DC 20): An
                     animal trained for hunting knows the tricks attack, down,
                     fetch, heel, seek, and track. Training an animal for
                     hunting takes six weeks.  Performance (DC 15): An animal
                     trained for performance knows the tricks come, fetch,
                     heel, perform, and stay. Training an animal for
                     performance takes five weeks.  Riding (DC 15): An animal
                     trained to bear a rider knows the tricks come, heel, and
                     stay. Training an animal for riding takes three weeks.
                     Rear a Wild Animal: To rear an animal means to raise a
                     wild creature from infancy so that it becomes
                     domesticated. A handler can rear as many as three

                     Aid: You usually use first aid to save a dying

                     losing hit points (at the rate of 1 per round, 1 per hour,
                     or 1 per day), you can make him or her stable. A stable
                     character regains no hit points but stops losing them.
                     (See Dying, page 145.)  Long-Term Care: Providing
                     long-term care means treating a wounded person for a day
                     or more. If your Heal check is successful, the patient
                     recovers hit points or ability score points (lost to

                     creature wounded by stepping on a caltrop moves at
                     one-half normal speed.  A successful Heal check removes
                     this movement penalty.  A creature wounded by a spike
                     growth or spike stones spell must succeed on a Reflex save
                     or take injuries that reduce his speed by
                     one-third. Another character can remove this penalty by
                     taking 10 minutes to dress the victim’s injuries and
                     succeeding on a Heal check against the spell’s save DC.

                     more damage from the poison (or suffer some other

                     treat a disease means to tend a single diseased
                     character. Every time he or she makes a saving throw

  check              "Your Hide check is opposed by the Spot check of anyone
                     who might see you. You can move up to one-half your normal
                     speed and hide at no penalty. When moving at a speed
                     greater than one- half but less than your normal speed,
                     you take a –5 penalty. It’s practically impossible (–20
                     penalty) to hide while attacking, running or charging.
                     For example, Lidda has a speed of 20 feet. If she doesn’t
                     want to take a penalty on her Hide check, she can move
                     only 10 feet as a move action (up to a maximum of 20 feet
                     in a round).  A creature larger or smaller than Medium
                     takes a size bonus or penalty on Hide checks depending on
                     its size category: Fine +16, Diminutive +12, Tiny +8,
                     Small +4, Large –4, Huge –8, Gargantuan – 12, Colossal
                     –16.  You need cover or concealment (see pages 150–152) in
                     order to attempt a Hide check. Total cover or total
                     concealment usually (but not always; see Special, below)
                     obviates the need for a Hide check, since nothing can see
                     you anyway.  If people are observing you, even casually,
                     you can’t hide. You can run around a corner or behind
                     cover so that you’re out of sight and then hide, but the
                     others then know at least where you went. If your
                     observers are momentarily distracted (such as by a Bluff
                     check; see below), though, you can attempt to hide. While
                     the others turn their attention from you, you can attempt
                     a Hide check if you can get to a hiding place of some
                     kind. (As a general guideline, the hiding place has to be
                     within 1 foot per rank you have in Hide.) This check,
                     however, is made at a –10 penalty because you have to move
                     fast.

                     Sniping: If you’ve already successfully hidden at least 10
                     feet from your target, you can make one ranged attack,
                     then immediately hide again. You take a –20 penalty on
                     your Hide check to conceal yourself after the shot.
                     Creating a Diversion to Hide: You can use Bluff (page 67)
                     to help wyou hide. A successful Bluff check can give you
                     the momentary diversion you need to attempt a Hide check

                     target remains in your presence, and for 1d6×10 minutes
                     afterward. After this time, the target’s default attitude

                     the type of jump you are attempting (see below).  Your
                     Jump check is modified by your speed. If your speed is 30
                     feet (the speed of an unarmored human), then no modifier
                     based on speed applies to the check. If your speed is less

                     speed less than 30 feet. If your speed is greater than 30
                     feet, you gain a +4 bonus for every 10 feet beyond 30
                     feet. For instance, if you have a speed of 20 feet, you
                     take a –6 penalty on your Jump checks. If, on the other
                     hand, your speed is 50 feet, you gain a +8 bonus.  All
                     Jump DCs given here assume that you get a running start,
                     which requires that you move at least 20 feet in a
                     straight line before attempting the jump. If you do not
                     get a running start, the DC for the jump is doubled.
                     Distance moved by jumping is counted against your normal
                     maximum movement in a round. For example, Krusk has a
                     speed of 40 feet. If he moves 30 feet, then jumps across a
                     10-foot-wide chasm, he’s then moved 40 feet total, so
                     that’s his move action.  If you have ranks in Jump and you
                     succeed on a Jump check, you land on your feet (when
                     appropriate). If you attempt a Jump check untrained, you
                     land prone unless you beat the DC by 5 or more.  Long
                     Jump: A long jump is a horizontal jump, made across a gap
                     like a chasm or stream. At the midpoint of the jump, you
                     attain a vertical height equal to one-quarter of the
                     horizontal distance. The DC for the jump is equal to the
                     distance jumped (in feet). For example, a 10-foot-wide pit
                     requires a DC 10 Jump check to cross.  If your check
                     succeeds, you land on your feet at the far end. If you
                     fail the check by less than 5, you don’t clear the
                     distance, but you can make a DC 15 Reflex save to grab the
                     far edge of the gap. You end your movement grasping the
                     far edge. If that leaves you dangling over a chasm or gap,
                     getting up requires a move action and a DC 15 Climb check.
                     Long Jump Distance Jump DC1 5 feet 5 10 feet 10 15 feet 15
                     20 feet 20 25 feet 25 30 feet 30 1 Requires a 20-foot
                     running start. Without a running start, double the DC.
                     High Jump: A high jump is a vertical leap made to reach a
                     ledge high above or to grasp something overhead, such as a
                     tree limb. The DC is equal to 4 times the distance to be
                     cleared. For example, the DC for a high jump to land atop
                     a 3-foot-high ledge is 12 (3 × 4).  If you jumped up to
                     grab something, a successful check indicates that you
                     reached the desired height. If you wish to pull yourself
                     up, you can do so with a move action and a DC 15 Climb
                     check. If you fail the Jump check, you do not reach the
                     height, and you land on your feet in the same spot from
                     which you jumped. As with a long jump, the DC is doubled
                     if you do not get a running start of at least 20 feet.
                     High Jump Distance1 Jump DC2 1 foot 4 2 feet 8 3 feet 12 4

                     running start. Without a running start, double the DC.
                     Obviously, the difficulty of reaching a given height
                     varies according to the size of the character or
                     creature. The maximum vertical reach (height the creature
                     can reach without jumping) for an average creature of a
                     given size is shown on the table below. (As a Medium
                     creature, a typical human can reach 8 feet without
                     jumping.)  Quadrupedal creatures (such as horse) don’t
                     have the same vertical reach as a bipedal creature; treat
                     them as being one size category smaller.  Creature Size
                     Vertical Reach Colossal 128 ft.  Gargantuan 64 ft.  Huge
                     32 ft.  Large 16 ft.  Medium 8 ft.  Small 4 ft.  Tiny 2
                     ft.  Diminutive 1 ft.  Fine 1/2 ft.  Hop Up: You can jump
                     up onto an object as tall as your waist, such as a table
                     or small boulder, with a DC 10 Jump check. Doing so counts
                     as 10 feet of movement, so if your speed is 30 feet, you
                     could move 20 feet, then hop up onto a counter. You do not
                     need to get a running start to hop up, so the DC is not
                     doubled if you do not get a running start.  Jumping Down:
                     If you intentionally jump from a height, you take less
                     damage than you would if you just fell. The DC to jump
                     down from a height is 15. You do not have to get a running
                     start to jump down, so the DC is not doubled if you do not
                     get a running start.  If you succeed on the check, you
                     take falling damage as if you had dropped 10 fewer feet
                     than you actually did. Thus, if you jump down from a
                     height of just 10 feet, you take no damage. If you jump
                     down from a height of 20 feet, you take damage as if you
                     had fallen 10 feet.";

                     Soft fall 15 1 Armor check penalty applies.  Guide with
                     Knees: You can react instantly to guide your mount with
                     your knees so that you can use both hands in combat. Make
                     your Ride check at the start of your turn. If you fail,
                     you can use only one hand this round because you need to
                     use the other to control your mount.  Stay in Saddle: You
                     can react instantly to try to avoid falling when your
                     mount rears or bolts unexpectedly or when you take damage.
                     This usage does not take an action.  Fight with Warhorse:
                     If you direct your war-trained mount to attack in battle,
                     you can still make your own attack or attacks
                     normally. This usage is a free action.

                     Cover: You can react instantly to drop down and hang
                     alongside your mount, using it as cover. You can’t attack
                     or cast spells while using your mount as cover. If you
                     fail your Ride check, you don’t get the cover
                     benefit. This usage does not take an action.

                     Soft Fall: You can react instantly to try to take no
                     damage when you fall off a mount—when it is killed or when
                     it falls, for example.  If you fail your Ride check, you
                     take 1d6 points of falling damage.  This usage does not
                     take an action.

                     Leap: You can get your mount to leap obstacles as part of
                     its movement. Use your Ride modifier or the mount’s Jump
                     modifier, whichever is lower, to see how far the creature
                     can jump. If you fail your Ride check, you fall off the
                     mount when it leaps and take the appropriate falling
                     damage (at least 1d6 points). This usage does not take an
                     action, but is part of the mount’s movement.  Spur Mount:
                     You can spur your mount to greater speed with a move
                     action. A successful Ride check increases the mount’s
                     speed by 10 feet for 1 round but deals 1 point of damage
                     to the creature. You can use this ability every round, but
                     each consecutive round of additional speed deals twice as
                     much damage to the mount as the previous round (2 points,
                     4 points, 8 points, and so on).  Control Mount in Battle:
                     As a move action, you can attempt to control a light
                     horse, pony, heavy horse, or other mount not trained for
                     combat riding while in battle. If you fail the Ride check,
                     you can do nothing else in that round. You do not need to
                     roll for warhorses or warponies.  Fast Mount or Dismount:
                     You can attempt to mount or dismount from a mount of up to
                     one size category larger than yourself as a free action,
                     provided that you still have a move action available that
                     round. If you fail the Ride check, mounting or dismounting
                     is a move action. You can’t use fast mount or dismount on

                     that you don’t necessarily know whether you were
                     successful.  Task Sense Motive DC Hunch 20 Sense
                     enchantment 25 or 15 Discern secret message Varies.

                     Hunch: This use of the skill involves making a gut
                     assessment of the social situation. You can get the
                     feeling from another’s behavior that something is wrong,
                     such as when you’re talking to an impostor. Alternatively,
                     you can get the feeling that someone is trustworthy.

                     Sense Enchantment: You can tell that someone’s behavior is
                     being influenced by an enchantment effect (by definition,
                     a mind-affect- ing effect), such as charm person, even if
                     that person isn’t aware of it.  The usual DC is 25, but if
                     the target is dominated (see dominate person in Chapter
                     11: Spells), the DC is only 15 because of the lim- ited
                     range of the target’s activities.  Discern Secret Message:
                     You may use Sense Motive to detect that a hidden message
                     is being transmitted via the Bluff skill. In this case,
                     your Sense Motive check is opposed by the Bluff check of
                     the character transmitting the message. For each piece of
                     information relating to the message that you are missing,
                     you take a –2 penalty on your Sense Motive check. For
                     example, if you eavesdrop on people planning to
                     assassinate a visiting diplomat, you take a –2 penalty on
                     your check if you don’t know about the diplomat. If you
                     succeed by 4 or less, you know that something hidden is
                     being communicated, but you can’t learn anything specific
                     about its content. If you beat the DC by 5 or more, you
                     intercept and understand the message. If you fail by 4 or
                     less, you don’t detect any hidden communication. If you
                     fail by 5 or more, you infer some false information.";

  restrictions       TRAINED ONLY;
  check              "A DC 10 Sleight of Hand check lets you palm a coin-
                     sized, unattended object. Performing a minor feat of
                     legerdemain, such as making a coin disappear, also has a
                     DC of 10 unless an observer is determined to note where
                     the item went.  When you use this skill under close
                     observation, your skill check is opposed by the observer’s
                     Spot check. The observer’s success doesn’t prevent you
                     from performing the action, just from doing it unnoticed.
                     You can hide a small object (including a light weapon,
                     such as a handaxe, or an easily concealed ranged weapon,
                     such as a dart, sling, or hand crossbow) on your
                     body. Your Sleight of Hand check is opposed by the Spot
                     check of anyone observing you or the Search check of
                     anyone frisking you. In the latter case, the searcher
                     gains a +4 bonus on the Search check, since it’s generally
                     easier to find such an object than to hide it. A dagger is
                     easier to hide than most light weapons, and grants you a
                     +2 bonus on your Sleight of Hand check to conceal it. An
                     extraordinarily small object, such as a coin, shuriken, or
                     ring, grants you a +4 bonus on your Sleight of Hand check
                     to conceal it, and heavy or baggy clothing (such as a
                     cloak) grants you a +2 bonus on the check. Drawing a
                     hidden weapon is a standard action and doesn’t provoke an
                     attack of opportunity.  If you try to take something from
                     another creature, you must make a DC 20 Sleight of Hand
                     check to obtain it. The opponent makes a Spot check to
                     detect the attempt, opposed by the same Sleight of Hand
                     check result you achieved when you tried to grab the
                     item. An opponent who succeeds on this check notices the
                     attempt, regardless of whether you got the item.  You can
                     also use Sleight of Hand to entertain an audience as
                     though you were using the Perform skill. In such a case,

                     seen. Sometimes a creature isn’t intentionally hiding but
                     is still difficult to see, so a successful Spot check is
                     necessary to notice it.  A Spot check result higher than

                     use of the skill is language-dependent.) The base DC is

                     speed (as a move action).  If you fail by 4 or less, you
                     make no progress through the water. If you fail by 5 or
                     more, you go underwater.  If you are underwater, either
                     because you failed a Swim check or because you are
                     swimming underwater intentionally, you must hold your

                     even when you’re not and even if you don’t know it. You do
                     have to perform some equivalent activity in order to make
                     the check. That is, you must speak, wave the item around,
                     or otherwise attempt to get it to activate. You get a
                     special +2 bonus on your Use Magic Device check if you’ve
                     activated the item in question at least once before.  If
                     you fail by 9 or less, you can’t activate the device. If
                     you fail by 10 or more, you suffer a mishap. A mishap
                     means that magical energy gets released but it doesn’t do
                     what you wanted it to do. The DM determines the result of
                     a mishaps, as with scroll mishaps. The default mishaps are
                     that the item affects the wrong target or that un-
                     controlled magical energy is released, dealing 2d6 points
                     of damage to you.  This mishap is in addition to the
                     chance for a mishap that you normally run when you cast a
                     spell from a scroll that you could not otherwise cast
                     yourself (see the Dungeon Master’s Guide).  Decipher a
                     Written Spell: This usage works just like deciphering a
                     written spell with the Spellcraft skill, except that the
                     DC is 5 points higher. Deciphering a written spell
                     requires 1 minute of concen- tration.  Emulate an Ability
                     Score: To cast a spell from a scroll, you need a high
                     score in the appro- priate ability (Intelligence for
                     wizard spells, Wisdom for divine spells, or Charisma for
                     sorcerer or bard spells). Your effective ability score
                     (appropriate to the class you’re emulating when you try to
                     cast the spell from the scroll) is your Use Magic Device
                     check result minus 15. If you already have a high enough
                     score in the appropriate ability, you don’t need to make
                     this check.  Emulate an Alignment: Some magic items have
                     positive or negative effects based on the user’s
                     alignment. Use Magic Device lets you use these items as if
                     you were of an alignment of your choice. For example, a
                     book of vile darkness damages nonevil characters who touch
                     it. With a successful Use Magic Device check, Lidda could
                     emulate an evil alignment so that she could handle a book
                     of vile darkness safely. You can emulate only one
                     alignment at a time.  Lidda finds that using a magic
                     device can be risky.  Illus.byJ.Foster Emulate a Class
                     Feature: Sometimes you need to use a class feature to
                     activate a magic item. In this case, your effective level
                     in the emulated class equals your Use Magic Device check
                     result minus 20.  For example, Lidda finds a magic chalice
                     that turns regular water into holy water when a cleric or
                     an experienced paladin channels positive energy into it as
                     if turning undead. She attempts to activate the item by
                     emulating the cleric’s undead turning ability. Her
                     effective cleric level is her check result minus 20. Since
                     a cleric can turn undead at 1st level, she needs a Use
                     Magic Device check result of 21 or higher to succeed.
                     This skill does not let you actually use the class feature
                     of another class. It just lets you activate items as if
                     you had that class feature.  If the class whose feature
                     you are emulating has an alignment requirement, you must
                     meet it, either honestly or by emulating an appropriate
                     alignment with a separate Use Magic Device check (see
                     above).  Emulate a Race: Some magic items work only for
                     members of certain races, or work better for members of
                     those races. You can use such an item as if you were a
                     race of your choice. For example, Lidda, a halfling, could
                     attempt to use a dwarven thrower (see page 226 of the
                     Dungeon Master’s Guide) as if she were a dwarf. If she
                     failed her Use Magic Device check, the hammer would work
                     for her as it normally would for a halfling, but if she
                     succeeded, it would work for her as if she were a
                     dwarf. You can emulate only one race at a time.  Use a
                     Scroll: If you are casting a spell from a scroll, you have
                     to decipher it first. Normally, to cast a spell from a
                     scroll, you must have the scroll’s spell on your class
                     spell list. Use Magic Device allows you to use a scroll as
                     if you had a particular spell on your class spell
                     list. The DC is equal to 20 + the caster level of the
                     spell you are trying to cast from the scroll. For
                     instance, to cast web (a 2nd-level wizard spell) from a
                     scroll, you would need a Use Magic Device check result of
                     23 or better, since the minimum caster level for web is
                     3rd level. See the Dungeon Master’s Guide for more
                     information on scrolls.  In addition, casting a spell from
                     a scroll requires a minimum score (10 + spell level) in
                     the appropriate ability. If you don’t have a sufficient
                     score in that ability, you must emulate the ability score
                     with a separate Use Magic Device check (see above).  This
                     use of the skill also applies to other spell completion
                     magic items. The Dungeon Master’s Guide has more
                     information on such items.  Use a Wand: Normally, to use a
                     wand, you must have the wand’s spell on your class spell
                     list. This use of the skill allows you to use a wand as if
                     you had a particular spell on your class spell list.  This
                     use of the skill also applies to other spell trigger magic
                     items, such as staffs. The Dungeon Master’s Guide has more
                     information on such items.";

                     grappling hook is thrown, to a maximum DC of 20 at 50
                     feet). Failure by 4 or less indicates that the hook fails
                     to catch and falls, allowing you to try again. Failure by
