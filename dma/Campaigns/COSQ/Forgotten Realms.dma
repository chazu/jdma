              item with incomplete Caltrops [Caltrops] =
              incomplete        "The following aspects of the item are not yet handled by
              jDMA. They could be handled by adding the ability to create a
              construct with speed 0, reach 0 ft and the given attach modes.
              Each time a creature moves into an area covered by caltrops
              (or spends a round fighting while standing in such an area),
              it might step on one. The caltrops make an attack roll (base
              attack bonus +0) against the creature. For this attack, the
              creature's shield, armor, and deflection bonuses do not
              count. (Deflection averts blows as they approach, but it does
              not prevent a creature from touching something dangerous.) If
              the creature is wearing shoes or other footwear, it gets a +2
              armor bonus to AC. If the caltrops succeed on the attack, the
              creature has stepped on one. The caltrop deals 1 point of
              damage, and the creature s speed is reduced by one-half
              because its foot is wounded. This movement penalty lasts for
              24 hours, or until the creature is successfully treated with a
              DC 15 Heal check, or until it receives at least 1 point of
              magical curing. A charging or running creature must
              immediately stop if it steps on a caltrop. Any creature moving
              at half speed or slower can pick its way through a bed of
              caltrops with no trouble. The DM judges the effectiveness of
              caltrops against unusual opponents. A Small monstrous
              centipede, for example, can slither through an area containing
              caltrops with no chance of hurting itself, and a fire giant
              wearing fire giant-sized boots is immune to normal-size
              caltrops. (They just get stuck in the soles of his boots.)";

              incomplete        "The following aspects of the item are not yet handled by
              jDMA. They could be handled by adding the ability to create a
              construct with speed 0, reach 0 ft and the given attach modes.
              Each time a creature moves into an area covered by caltrops
              (or spends a round fighting while standing in such an area),
              it might step on one. The caltrops make an attack roll (base
              attack bonus +0) against the creature. For this attack, the
              creature's shield, armor, and deflection bonuses do not
              count. (Deflection averts blows as they approach, but it does
              not prevent a creature from touching something dangerous.) If
              the creature is wearing shoes or other footwear, it gets a +2
              armor bonus to AC. If the caltrops succeed on the attack, the
              creature has stepped on one. The caltrop deals 1 point of
              damage, and the creature s speed is reduced by one-half
              because its foot is wounded. This movement penalty lasts for
              24 hours, or until the creature is successfully treated with a
              DC 15 Heal check, or until it receives at least 1 point of
              magical curing. A charging or running creature must
              immediately stop if it steps on a caltrop. Any creature moving
              at half speed or slower can pick its way through a bed of
              caltrops with no trouble. The DM judges the effectiveness of
              caltrops against unusual opponents. A Small monstrous
              centipede, for example, can slither through an area containing
              caltrops with no chance of hurting itself, and a fire giant
              wearing fire giant-sized boots is immune to normal-size
              caltrops. (They just get stuck in the soles of his boots.)";
