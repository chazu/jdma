                    lurk in its shadowed entranceways and dimly-lit streets.

                    this incredible new boxed set dealing with urban fantasy
                    adventures. \Place{Waterdeep} is detailed in no less than 10 expanded maps,
                    embellished with typical building interiors suitable for use in any campaign
                    setting. In addition, a full-size poster of \Place{Waterdeep} is provided,
                    along with a grand-scale three-dimensional map of \Place{Castle Waterdeep},
                    hub of the city's government.
                    In addition to all these maps, a 32-page City System booklet provides
                    encounters and street scenes, special features and details of
                    \Place{Waterdeep}, and methods for creating types of buildings in moments and
                    filling the pockets of those unfortunate enough to get in a player
                    character's way. Designed for use with \Place{Waterdeep}, these new features
                    are suitable for use anywhere in the \Place{Forgotten Realms}!

                    Between East and West, between Earth and Sky, lies the \Place{Endless
                    Waste}. Barren and desolate, this windswept land forms the barrier between
                    the feuding kingdoms of \Place{Faer\hat{u}n} and the ancient empires of
                    \Place{Kara-Tur}. The eternal steppe is home only to hardy, nomadic horsemen
                    who travel its secret paths.
                    This region, long ignored by its neighbors, is about to erupt in the
                    gloodiest conflict ever to sweep across the \Place{Forgotten
                    Realms}. \NPC{Yamun Khahan}, Emperor of the \Group{Tuigan}, has united the
                    barbarian tribes into an unstoppable horde. Already he rules the steppes,
                    from the \Place{Cave of a Thousand Gods} to the \Place{Valley of the
                    Dog-Men}. Driven to conquer, \NPC{Yamun Khahan} looks both east and west, and
                    sees a world ripe for harvest.

                    gentle demeanor. Beware, though, the dark side of this beauty: the gods of
                    this place are very much alive, and their troubles are the people's
                    troubles.
                    Set in the countries first described in the \Place{Maztica} trilogy of
                    novels, this campaign set provides players and DMs with all the information
                    necessary to recreate the storyline of \Product[TSR 8475]{Ironhelm},
                    \Product[TSR 8476]{Viperhand}, and \Product[TSR 8477]{Feathered Dragon}, or
                    to build a campaign of their own. Four new character classes, \Class{Eagle
                    Knight}s, \Class{Jaguar Knight}s, \Class{Plumaweaver}s, and
                    \Class{Hishnashaper}s, add to the mystique of \Place{Maztica}. New magical
                    spells and items, new deities, new proficiencies all add to the flavor of
                    this setting loosely based on the \Group{Aztecs} and \Group[Maya]{Mayans} of
                    \Place{Central America}.
                    This boxed campaign set includes:
                    \list
                    {\emph{A Journey to the True World}, a 96-page player's book;}

                    statistics for the \Group{Golden Legion} and various

                    again.}
                    \bold{Perhaps you've heard its shining story...} of a time when
                    \Monster[Elf]{elves} and \Monster[Dwarf]{dwarves}, \Monster[Gnome]{gnomes}
                    and \Monster[Halfling]{haflings} and \Monster[Human]{men} lived and loved
                    together, striving to create beauty and right wrongs. Magic was brighter
                    then, in the \Place[Myth Drannor]{City of Song}. Folk were richer then, in
                    the \Place[Myth Drannor]{City of Wonder}. Once this proud city stood as the
                    highest jewel in the glittering crown of civilization.
                    \bold{There came a day} when it was overwhelmed by evil, thrown down,
                    despoiled, and left a ruin in the heart of its encircling wood, as all things
                    of beauty are.
                    Evil spawned and crawled there, and the \Monster[Elf]{elves} kept watch
                    around it, that evil might not spread. Centuries passed, but the tales let
                    few forget the powerful magic, the great treasure---and the deadly horrors
                    that lay waiting within its walls.
                    Now the \Monster[Elf]{elves} are gone, and adventurers from a hundred lands
                    and cities are rushing to \Place{Myth Drannor}, to seize what they can of the
                    long-lost glory. If the \Class[Bard]{bards} and \Class[Sage]{sages} are
                    right, power lies there for the claiming that could chance the face of the
                    \Place[Forgotten Realms]{Realms}, rule kingdoms or lay waste to them.
                    If you would be part of this exciting quest, this boxed set if for
                    you. Inside await four poster maps, eight cardsheets, eight Monstrous
                    Compendium sheets, and two booklets---a 128-page Campaign Guide, and a
                    32-page Adventure Booklet---filled with details about \Place{Myth Drannor}, a
                    fully detailed campaign setting for high-level characters in the world of the
                    \Place{Forgotten Realms}. New monsters and magical items await to sparkle and
                    challenge in any AD&D campaign---and this set lays bare the secret at the
                    heart of \Place{Myth Drannor}; the fabled \Item{Mythal}!
                    Don't be left by the fireside, listening, wistful and poor. Join the rush for
                    gems and gold, magic and power! Open this box and enter into fabled
                    \Place{Myth Drannor}!".

  description       "\emph{'Looking for adventure, are ye? Looking for a place brimming with
                    silver and gold, a place dripping with things magical?'}
                    I know a place far and not far from here where all of that---and more---can
                    be had. But mind me lads and lassies, there are other things there as
                    well---danger and risk and uncertainty, and creatures never before seen by
                    the likes of sell-swords and wizards who tread upon the sun-lit lands of the
                    \Place[Forgotten Realms]{Realms}.
                    'This place is called \Place{Undermountain}. And it is far beneath the crust
                    of this world, yet right under fair \Place{Waterdeep}. It is a dangerous
                    labyrinth nestled deep in the bowels of the earth. It is a dungeon, I,
                    \NPC[Elminster]{Elminster of Shadowdale}, know well. I shall tell you of
                    these twisting corridors, and of a man who made them his. Liste ye
                    carefully---especially if ye are intent on delving into its depths. Perhaps
                    what I tell you could save your life. 'Perhaps'.
                    This sequel to \Product[TSR 1060]{The Ruins of Undermountain} contains the
                    128-page Campaign Guide to \Place{Undermountain}: The Deep Level, a 32-page
                    adventure booklet, a 16-page Monstrous Compendium booklet, four full-color,
                    poster-size maps of the levels described in this boxed set, and a set of
                    eight DM Assistance Cards to aid in trapping the corridors and rooms of this,
                    the greatest and most dangerous dungeon in all the \Place[Forgotten
                    Realms]{Realms}.
                    The original campaign expansion set wasn't enough? Well, then, pack your gear
                    and delve into \Product[TSR 1104]{Ruins of Undermountain II: The Deep
                    Levels}. The deep-dwellers await!".

  description       "An Excerpt from \emph{An Investigation into the Natural Systems of Organisms
                    and Their Surroundings} by \NPC[Elminster]{Elminster of Shadowdale}
                    \emph{The world is vast and varies, comprising towering mountains, dense
                    jungles, and sprawling seas. There are regions so cold that their snow never
                    melts, other so hot that their rain turns to steam as it touches the
                    ground.
                    It is this variety of environments that accounts for the variety of life. In
                    my travels I have noted 73 distinct types of pine trees...I estimate the
                    number of fishes at well over five thousand. The number of insect species
                    likely exceeds the number of grains of sand on the shores of \Place{Dragon
                    Reach}.
                    Every environment, no matter how hostile to humankind, is compatible with
                    some form of life. The diversity and adaptability of organisms are
                    staggering....}
                    Within this box are nine booklets. Eight of them, each written by an expert
                    in the area, describe various ecological niches on the continent of
                    \Place{Faer\hat{u}n}. Begin by reading the \emph{Explorer's Manual}, which:
                    \list
                    {introduces the read to the organization of the eight area-specific
                    bookelts,}
                    {contains the whole of the above excerpt of \NPC{Elminster}'s
                    work-in-progress about Realmsian biodiversity, and}
                    {provides color-coded encounter tables for the eight other booklet
                    along with instructions for their use.}
                    Would-be travelers are advised to read well the information presented by the
                    \NPC[Elminster]{Sage of Shadowdale} and his eight compatriots, and to
                    memorize the Rules of the \Monster{Rabbit}. There are only three: \emph{A
                    \Monster[Rabbit]{rabbit} isn't always a \Monster[Rabbit]{rabbit}. A
                    \Monster[Rabbit]{rabbit} doesn't want to be rich. A \Monster[Rabbit]{rabbit}
                    doesn't always stay put}. An explanation?  You'll find it in the
                    \emph{Explorer's Manual}. Read on, thou hearty adventurer!".

                    {Two 32-page adventures that immerse the PCs in the often-deadly power

                    of \Place{Tethyr}, from its origin as an \Monster[Elf]{elven} homeland
                    through its rise and falls as a \Monster[Human]{human} nation and up to its
                    recent restoration from anarchy. While this growin realm is now the
                    safest of the \Place{Lands of Intrigue}, it was once the seat of the
                    malevolent \Place[Shoon Empire]{Empire of Shoon}---whose influence still
                    haunts the golden plains in the form of roving monsters, wandering ghosts,

                    \Place{Amn}---or, as some call it, the \Place[Amn]{Coinland}. Money is
                    this country's lifeblood, whether gleaned from the trade along the
                    \Place{Sword Coast} or the far-off colonies of \Place{New
                    Amn}. However, a dark dawn has risen on those whose eyes see no
                    further than their ledgers or coin stacks...}
                    {\emph{Book Three: Erlkazar & Folk of Intrigue} (32 pages) reveals the
                    formerly undocumented domain of \Place{Erlkazar}, east of
                    \Place{Tethyr}---an area ready to be fleshed out by DMs to suit their
                    individual campaigns. \emph{Book Three} also holds the secrets of the
                    hidden powers of the South, such as the \Group{Cowled Wizards}, the
                    \Group{Knights of the Shield}, the \Group{Shadow Thieves}, and the

                    \Place{Pirate Isles of the Nelanther}, and the center of the
                    long-dead \Place{Shoon Empire}, the monster-riddled ruins of
                    \Place{Shoonach}.}

                    Cast out from their heavenly domain, the gods of the \Place{Forgotten Realms}
                    wander the land as mortals---extremely powerful mortals, to be certain, but
                    mortals nonetheless. They seek the lost \Item{Tablets of Fate}, key to their
                    return. But as the good and evil gods of the \Place[Forgotten Realms]{Realms}
                    bring their fight down to earth, the people and lands are caught in

                    even magic becomes unpredictable.

                    sorceress-mentor, little to they realize the size of the stakes they will

                    \NPC[Elminster]{old sage}. They're innocent, of course, but in this time of
                    troubles in the \Place[Forgotten Realms]{Realms}, truth and justice are not
                    always served. Imprisoned in the \Place{Tower of Ashaba}, the heroes must
                    escape if they are to survive!
                    Later, when the heroes start their quest for the first of the mysterious
                    \Item{Tablets of Fate}---mighty artifacats stolen from the overlord of the
                    gods himself---they come up against an even greater peril: \God{Bane}, the
                    \God[Bhaal]{God of Strife}, and his ally, the \God[Myrkul]{God of Death},
                    have set in motion a plot to capture the heroes and their companions. You
                    must face deadly assassins, nightmarish monsters, and violent storms on your
                    way across the \Place[Dales]{Dalelands}. And the worst threat of all is an
                    unexpected one---the man who helped you earlier has now joined the side of
                    \God{Bane} and the forces of \Place{Zhentil Keep}.

                    When a traitor to the empire is revealed, His Excellency calls loyal and

                    is grand---it seems that an entire army has turned its back on its rightful
                    liege!
                    The trail leads through trackless (or seemingly trackless) mountains, into

                    the heroes find their own reasons for continuing.

  description       "Dungeon delving can be delightful. Wandering the wilderness is a wonderful
                    way to pass the time. But for the ultimate in opportunity, intrigue, and
                    unexpected danger, try visiting the nearest village, town, or city.
                    A city is much more than a rest stop, a watering hole, or a place to buy
                    equipment. Any community, from the smallest hamlet to the most crowded
                    medieval metropolis, offers adventuring possibilities that can't be found in
                    any other environment. \Product[TSR 9262]{Cities of Mystery} describes for
                    the Dungeon Master how to create realistic, exciting, and vibrant
                    communities---and give him the tools to make his creations come alive.
                    Inside this folder are 12 different street layout patterns that can be
                    combined in a multitude of ways, plus 33 buildings of various shapes and
                    sizes that can be cut out and assembled. The components, scaled for use with
                    25mm miniature figures, allow you to create three-dimensional city scenes for
                    characters to explore. Also included is a 64-page book that takes you step by
                    step through the process of defining and designing the villages, towns, and
                    cities of your campaign world. The book contains five adventure scenarios
                    that make use of the street layouts and fold-up buildings---ideas designed to
                    get you started on the way of making your cities com alive.";

                    The mountains rumble under the thundering hoofbeats of 40'000 barbaric
                    horsemen. When the player characters find themselves in their path they have
                    no choice except to flee.
                    Their journey takes them into the forbidden kingdom of \Place{Ra-Khati}, a
                    land of ancient mysteries and untold wealth nestled deep within the

                    But when invaders threaten the \Place{Hidden Kingdom}, the player characters
                    are given a chance to earn their liberty. They are charged with escorting a
                    spoiled princess and her dowry, a ferocious black
                    \Monster[Horse]{stallion}, to a nearby kingdom as a bribe to stop a
                    war. Nothing stands in their way except 40'000 bloodthirsty riders and a
                    vengeful \Monster[Purple Dragon]{purple dragon}.
                    \Product[TSR 9281]{Storm Riders} is the first adventure in the

                    Devayam} is holding the \NPC{Dalai Lama} to his promise. If the
                    player-characters don't deliver Princess \NPC{Bhrokiti} and the \NPC{Black

                    army will once again march on the \Place{Hidden Kingdom}. What is it that
                    \NPC[Ambuchar Devayam]{Devayam} really wants with \Place{Ra-Khati}?
                    Only your player-characters can discover the awful truth. When they do, their
                    journey will take them to the farthest reaches of \Place{Shou

                    they will find the lost city of \Place{Kuo Meilan}. There, they must
                    penetrate to the lost city's wicked heart and find the \Item{Stone Sceptre of
                    Shih}. Only armed with this artifact, and the secret connecting it to
                    \NPC{Ambuchar Devayam}, can they hope to save \Place{Ra-Khati}---or
                    themselves!
                    \Product[TSR 9290]{The Black Courser} is the second adventure in the
                    \Product{Empires Adventures Trilogy}, taking place in the new

                    amidst the turbulent events protrayed in the \Product{Empires Novel

  description       "Situated where the \Place{Fire River} flows into the \Place{Sea of Fallen
                    Stars}, \Place{Ravens Bluff} is a bustling port and trade center. Residents
                    and frequent visitors to \Place{Ravens Bluff} often boast that the city is
                    the brightest spot on the \Place{Dragon Reach}, but even the proudest citizen
                    thinks twice about taking to the streets when the Veil, a thick, cold fog,
                    rolls in. The veil turns the city's vigorous docks into a gloomy den where
                    only the brave, the stubborn, or the foolish go abroad. When the veil drops,
                    neophyte adventurers join the \Group{Nightwatch}, a special police force that
                    sees to it that fearless citizens who prowl through the Veil restrict
                    themselves to licit business. A successful tour in the \Group{Nightwatch}
                    means wealth and recognition (those who fail quitely join the uncounted
                    dead). This modules is specially designed to introduce novice characters to
                    the rigors of adventuring.";

                    Gold} lies somewhere in its sandy depths.
                    So, too, do worse things: fell monsters, famous in adventurers' tales (and
                    listeners' nightmares) across the \Place[Forgotten Realms]{Realms}. Evil,

                    slumbers lightly, ever-ready to awaken and strike down the unwary intruder.
                    In the pages of this sourcebook, \Place{Anauroch} comes to life. Its dark,
                    innermost secrets are revealed, and the colorful cultures of the
                    \Group{Bedine}---and beings for worse---are explored. This guide to the most
                    important 'forgotten' land of the \Place{Forgotten Realms} presents new rules
                    galore: new spells, new adventures, new monsters---and much, much more.";

                    Such was not the case.
                    Rumors fly that the \Item{Cloak} was rescued that night, and hidden away in a
                    safe location. Now a petty noble of \Place{New Amn} plans to recover it, and
                    is looking for brave young souls who can bring it back to him. But other
                    players are involved in the chase, trying to recover the lost \Item{Cloak}.

                    A secret that has remained inviolate until now.
                    A cleric of the church of \God{Helm} has disappeared. A piece of a map to the

                    At the climax of \Product[TSR 9341]{Nightmare Keep}: 'Oh no. Oh no.'
                    A would-be conqueror is raising hordes of undead insects beneath

  description       "Somewhere in the \Place{True World}, to the north of the lands you know,
                    lies the \Place[Michaca]{City of Gold}: \Place{Michaca}. It is a city of
                    legend, of fable, and of wonder. The journey is hard, and the perils are
                    many; you know, however, that the rewards will far outshine any treasure you
                    have ever seen.
                    This supplement for the \Place{Maztica} Campaign Setting is a new type of
                    product: a combination adventure and accessory. In this booklet you will find
                    information on a new character race, the \Monster{Azuposi}; on new character
                    classes for rogues, including the clown (or \emph{koyemshis}); on new priest
                    classes, including the 'bent priest'; and a new magic unique to
                    \Place{Maztica}, fetishism.
                    The adventure itself leads your party from the known areas of the \Place{True
                    World} into the northlands, through the lands of the \Monster[Desert
                    Dwarf]{desert dwarves}, the \Monster[Poscada Elf]{Poscada elves}, the
                    \Group{Dog People}, and others. Your characters will also confront spirits
                    they've never heard of: the spirits that have caused the downfall of
                    \Place{Michaca}, the \Place[Michaca]{City of Gold}.
                    And do not forget the words of a poet of another place, and another time:
                    'Nor all that tempts your wand'ring eyes / And headless hearts, is lawful
                    price; / Nor all, that glisters, gold.'";

                    \right{---\NPC{Inum}}
                    Strange sentiments, perhaps, from one who lives in what many perceive as a
                    frozen wasteland, but the philosopher \NPC{Inum} speaks for the
                    \Group[Ulutiun]{Ulutiun people} of the \Place{Great Glacier}. Their tribes
                    share that icy landscape with arctic \Monster[Dwarf]{dwarves} who enjoy
                    sunbathing, sled-animals that are hardier than dogs, and fierce montsters
                    that live nowhere else---and thrive in the freezing air.
                    \Product[TSR 9351]{The Great Glacier} is the first supplement for the
                    \Place{Forgotten Realms} campaign setting to detail an \Group{Inuit}-base
                    culture. In this booklet is fact-based information on building a snow-house,
                    surviving in sub-zero temperatures for extended periods of time, and more
                    ideas for fantasy campaigning in an arctic setting. For those who are tired
                    of the normal, temperate,
                    'you-meet-in-the-tavern-and-proceed-to-go-adventuring' games, here's
                    something completely different.
                    Make sure your characters dress warmly---it gets nippy at night on the
                    \Place{Great Glacier}.
                    This accessory is suitable for use by all levels of play.";

                    Here, the \Group{Knights of Myth Drannor} began their famous

                    clutching royal charters from \NPC[King Azoun IV]{King Azoun} with the ink
                    scarcely dry on the parchment. Some fell, some went on to greatness---but
                    they all come here first: here, to the \Place{Haunted Halls}.
                    Despite numerous infiltrations, the \Place[Haunted Halls]{Halls} have not yet
                    yielded all their secrets and treasures. Many dangers lurk as deadly as ever
                    in dark chambers herein, awaiting new companies of eager-eye adventurers.
                    Is it your turn to dare \Place[Haunted Halls]{The Haunted
                    Halls}? Many come, but few survive to again see \Place{Eveningstar}'s beauty.
                    Welcome, then. Enter in, and find in these pages:
                    \list

                    source of a curse affecting the entire town. People are taking ill, animals
                    are dying overnight, crops are failing. All this seems to have started after
                    \NPC{Eragyn}, priestess of \God{Cyric}, disappeared from
                    \Place{Daggerdale}. Shortly before that, a forgotten mage-lord's crypt was
                    discovered and opened; things just haven't been the same since.
                    \NPC[Tren]{Constable Tren} is displeased with the situation, what with
                    suspicion being cast in the \Group{Zhentarim}'s direction as well as toward
                    \God{Cyric}'s priesthood. He's undoubtedly making the \Group{Dalesfolk}'s
                    lives more difficult than usual because of this upheaval. \NPC[Randal
                    Morn]{Randal} has sent out the call for aid to all who are interested and
                    able to help; his \Group[Freedom Riders]{freedom riders} have their hands
                    full already.
                    A missing evil priestess, a mage-lord's crypt-curse, a plague, a possible
                    \Group{Zhentarim} involvement: all the elements of a rousing adventure in one
                    place! Where do your characters sign up? Step right this way, won't you?

  description       "For many years, \Place{Evermeet} has remained a mystery, known only as the
                    \Monster[Elf]{elves}' place of refuge. So far, details about the island
                    itself, its geography, and society have been sketchy. It is known that
                    \Place{Evermeet} is protected by illusory magic, that ships lose their way or
                    vanish mysteriously if they approach the isle, and that the
                    \Monster[Elf]{elven} navy is the finest in the realms. Past publications have
                    also revealed that \Place{Evermeet} is ruled by \NPC[Amlaruil]{Queen
                    Amlaruil}, and that her husband \NPC{Zaor} was murdered decades ago. Beyond
                    this, little is known.
                    The \Product[TSR 9430]{Elves of Evermeet} attempts to investigate and explain
                    the inner workings of the \Monster[Elf]{elven} island, and develop the realm
                    as a setting for \Place{Forgotten Realms} adventures. Until now,
                    \Place{Evermeet} has been reserved exclusively for the \Monster[Elf]{elves}
                    and officially closed to \Monster[Human]{humans}, \Monster[Dwarf]{dwarves},
                    and other races. But this product will help you work \Place{Evermeet} into
                    your campaign and allow other PC races to visit, or at least interact, with
                    the mysterious island.
                    Included are:
                    \list
                    {new \Monster[Elf]{elven} magic (for High Mages),}

  description       "\Product[TSR 9444]{Marco Volo: Departure} is the first volume of the

                    player characters of levels 6-8. This free-wheeling adventure begins with an
                    intrigue-laden journey from \Place{Waterdeep} to \Place{Shadowdale}. The
                    party is thrown into the company of one \NPC[Marcus Wands]{Marcus Wands}
                    (also known as '\NPC{Marco Volo}'), a bothersome but likeable little
                    rogue. In his guise of \NPC[Marco Volo]{Marco}, he gains unintentional help
                    from the party members, leading only to their own arrests. To remedy that
                    predicament, the characters are strong-armed into carrying an important
                    letter to Shadowdale, and taking along \NPC[Marcus Wands]{Marcus} as their
                    'guide'.
                    Of course, things are nowhere near as simple as they seem.
                    There's this little matter of the \Item{Dragonking's Eye}, a powerful
                    artifact from another plane. Naively, \NPC[Marcus Wands]{Marcus} thought he
                    could steal the thing and pin the theft on \NPC{Volothamp Geddarm}, the
                    roguish author of many popular books about cities in the \Place[Forgotten
                    Realms]{Realms}. The notorious mage-assassin \NPC{Felibarr Blacklance} has
                    been hired to hunt the thief, and he is a man grimly determined to earn his
                    fee.
                    Then, there's the business about this letter that's on its way to
                    \Place{Shadowdale}. It is accompanied by a rare enchanted item that wizards
                    and fortune hunters want to obtain at all costs.
                    A series of adventures ensues that takes the adventurers from
                    \Place{Waterdeep} to the \Place{Way Inn}, by which time they will doubtless
                    suspect there is more to \NPC{Marco Volo} than meets the eye. Amid the brawls
                    and mistaken identities, the wild rides and glowering villains, the
                    characters never have a chance to slow down or catch their collective
                    breath. What results is a light-hearted, picaresque adventure in the manner
                    of Dumas and Sabatini, and a good time is had by all!
                    (Except the bad guys, of course. They're never happy with how things are
                    turning out...)".

                    player characters of 6th--8th level. This free-wheeling adventure began in
                    \Place{Waterdeep} as the characters set out an intrigue-laden journey to
                    \Place{Shadowdale}. Accompanying them is \NPC{Marcus Wands} (also known as
                    '\NPC{Marco Volo}'), a bothersome but likeable little rogue.
                    After leaving the \Place{Way Inn}, the party heads for the
                    \God[Chauntea]{Chauntean} Monastery near \Place{Berdusk}, where they have
                    been promised save shelter. Arriving at the monastery, all seems pastoral and
                    pleasant... but of course, things are never quite that simple.
                    After escaping from the monsastery, the PCs run afoul of \NPC[King Azoun
                    IV]{King Azoun}'s \Group{Purple Dragons} on the lookout for the infamous
                    thief, \NPC{Marco Volo}. Only the timely intervention of a band of wandering
                    entertainers enables the party to continue on its way.
                    While on the road with \Group{Heino's Woodland Troupe}, the characters learn
                    the joys of being in a traveling repertory company, performing for a
                    different audience each night. In the course of the adventure, the PCs also
                    learn more about \NPC[Marcus Wands]{Marcus} and his secrets---some of his
                    secrets, anyway. There's still the matter of the mysterious letter, and that
                    powerful artifact from another plane, the \Item{Dragonking's Eye}.
                    The adventure ends with \Place{Shadowdale} in sight not to be reached,
                    however, without a final confrontation with the notorious mage-assassin
                    \NPC{Felibarr Blacklance}.
                    This volume of the \Product[Marco Volo Trilogy]{Marco Volo} trilogy offers
                    DMs the opportunity to run unusual encounters, and it call for considerable
                    role playing from all. Player characters cannot easily rely on their swords
                    and spells to get them out of the brawls and misunderstandings that
                    arise. What results is a dramatic but picaresque enterprise as the adventure
                    continues!".

  description       "\Product[TSR 9455]{Marco Volo---Arrival} is the third and last volume of the
                    \Product[Marco Volo Trilogy]{Marco Volo} trilogy, designed for four to eight
                    player characters of 6th--8th level. When the characters first set off on an
                    intrigue-laden journey to \Place{Shadowdale}, they did not suspect how much
                    trouble they would get into. Joined by \NPC{Marcus Wands} (also known as
                    '\NPC{Marco Volo}'), they found him just a bothersome but likebale little
                    rogue. No one suspected he was on the run from the crazy wizard
                    \NPC{Sabbar}. The troublesome \NPC[Marcus Wands]{Marcus} had previously
                    stolen from him a rare artifact called the \Item{Dragonking's Eye}, and hid
                    it in the \Place{Spiderhaunt Woods}.
                    Now the party approaches the \Place[Spiderhaunt Woods]{Spiderhaunts}, and
                    \NPC[Marcus Wands]{Marcus} insists on diverting the group to retrieve the
                    \Item{Eye}. But strange things have been happening there. There are rumors:
                    of an oddly constructed keep of bone (or is it crystal?); of a warlord out
                    for conquest (or is it a \Monster[Lich]{lich}?); of \Monster[Goblin]{goblin}
                    tribes strangely clad, and extra-planar beings banding with the
                    \Monster[Giant Spider]{giant spiders} of the aptly named \Place{Spiderhaunt
                    Woods}. Something evil has denned at the heart of the forest. It has a mind
                    of its own... and it has plans for \Place{Faer\hat{u}n}.
                    The last volume of the \Product[Marco Volo Trilogy]{Marco Volo} trilogy gives
                    a DM the tools to run this free-wheeling, fast-paced adventure, and the
                    secrets of the powers at work behind the scenes. The player characters must
                    face---and deal with---the mad wizard \NPC{Sabbar}, the annoyed
                    \NPC{Volothamp Geddarm} (who wants to have 'a little chat' with \NPC[Marcus
                    Wands]{Marcus}!), and ultimately the \Item{Dragonking's Eye} itself. Even the
                    gods themselves step in to have their say. In a dramatic denouement, this
                    epic adventure draws to a close, but the memory of what transpired will live
                    on!".

  description       "Beautiful, powerful, mysterious, and deadly---the silver-haired \Group{Seven
                    Sisters} are legendary throughout the \Place{Forgotten Realms}.
                    One rules the city of bards, \Place{Silverymoon}. Another is
                    \NPC{Elminster}'s beloved and the infamous \NPC[The Simbul]{Witch-Queen of
                    Aglarond}. The third is the \NPC[Laeral]{Lady Mage of Waterdeep}, peer and
                    consort of \NPC{Khelben 'Blackstaff' Arunsun}, and the fourth is a
                    \Group[Harpers]{Harper} and one of the famous \Group{Knights of Myth
                    Drannor}. The fifth is a leader of the \Group{Harpers} and a legendary bard
                    in her own right, and the sixth is a dead---perhaps undead---with. And the
                    seventh? She's the one who wild tales are whispered about all across
                    \Place{Faer\hat{u}n} around many a fireside late at night.
                    But who are they, really? Their very names conjure up romance, allure, and
                    power---\NPC{Storm Silverhand}, \NPC[The Simbul]{the Simbul},
                    \NPC[Alustriel]{High Lady Alustriel}. Sages say they are among the
                    \Group{Chosen of Mystra}, archmages who wield magic few can dare to stand
                    against. Yet these seven do not seek to rule the world, and they often stay
                    quiet and hidden for generations.
                    That hints at another thing. These seven seem immortal, never aging as the
                    long years pass. Just who are these \Group{Seven Sisters}, and what are their
                    secrets?
                    Read this tome, and learn what the \Group{Zhentarim}, the \Group{Red Wizards}
                    of \Place{Thay}, and the \Group{Cult of the Dragon} could not, despite
                    performing many fell deeds in the attempt. Learn the stories of these great

  description       "\Item{The Sword of the Dales}, an icon of the \Place[Dales]{Dalelands}
                    symbolizing the unity and strength of the people, has reappeared!  Created by
                    \NPC{Shraevyn} the weapons-mage hundreds of years ago, the lost \Item[The
                    Sword of the Dales]{Sword} had become nothing more than a fantastic
                    children's tale---until now.
                    A group of warriors led by \NPC{Randal Morn}, rightful rule of
                    \Place{Daggerdale}, rushed to the \Item{Sword}'s resting place to recover it,
                    but dark forces awaited them, and \NPC[Randal Morn]{Randal} and his men fell
                    to an ambush. Only one man escaped, yet he brought with him the hope that
                    \NPC{Randal Morn} yet lives. Resolved to rescue his leader, that lone
                    survivor turned to the great \NPC{Elminster} of \Place{Shadowdale} for aid.
                    But \NPC{Elminster} is gone, off plane-hopping while the fate of
                    \Place{Daggerdale} hangs in the balance. Hence, it is up to \NPC{Lhaeo},
                    scribe of the old mage, to find a group of heroes who have mettle enough to
                    face down the menace which claimed \NPC{Randal Morn} and his hearty
                    followers...
                    This is the first of three adventures that grant player characters the
                    opportunity to determine the fate of \Place{Daggerdale}. The saga continues
                    with \Product[TSR 9485]{The Secret of Spiderhaunt} and concludes with
                    \Product[TSR 9488]{The Return of Randal Morn}.".

  description       "The infamous \Item[The Sword of the Dales]{Sword of the Dales} has always
                    held a certain fascination in the eyes and hearts of the citizens of the
                    \Place[Dales]{Dalelands}. Thus, it was not surprise when \NPC{Randal Morn},
                    revel leader of \Place{Daggerdale}, led an expedition into the crypt of a
                    long-dead wizard to recover the weapon.
                    \NPC{Shraevyn} the weapons-mage had created the \Item[The Sword of the
                    Dales]{Sword} long ago, and it stood to reason that the blade would be
                    waiting within his tomb. Perhaps the \Item[The Sword of the Dales]{Sword of
                    the Dales} would allow \NPC{Randal Morn} to rule \Place{Daggerdale} once
                    again. But \NPC{Randal Morn} never returned from that fated party. Only tales
                    of terror told by a lone survivor held any clues as to \NPC[Randal
                    Morn]{Randal}'s fate. A brave band of heroes accomplished what \NPC{Randal
                    Morn}'s group failed to do in part one of this trilogy, \Product[TSR
                    8484]{The Sword of the Dales}.
                    Battling through the tomb's undead inhabitants, those heroes reached the
                    burial crypt of \NPC{Shraevyn}. There, resting in the center of the coffin,
                    was the \Item[The Sword of the Dales]{Sword of the Dales}, its azure glow
                    filling the chamber. However, there was no sign of \NPC{Randal Morn}.
                    Only a note signed by his hand held any clue as to his fate. 'Seek me in
                    \Place[Spiderhaunt Woods]{Spiderhaunt}', it proclaimed. 'The fate of
                    \Place{Daggerdale} is in your hands'.
                    This is the second of a trilogy of modules that began with \Product[TSR
                    9484]{The Sword of the Dales}. The saga concludes with \Product[TSR
                    9488]{The Return of Randal Morn}.".

                    was emanating from two towering braziers, one on either side of the
                    entrance. Deep gauges---now she could see they were runes, of ancient
                    origin---ringed their bases and rims, their lines and curves carved by
                    instruments far larger than any she could wield.
                    Her eyes adjusted slowly to the darkness within the \Monster[Stone

                    and portraits, all carved in bas-relief with artistry like none she had seen
                    back home in \Place{Shadowdale}. \NPC{Kiruna} stood for a moment, gazing on
                    these immense figures and faces, her reverie broken only by the realization
                    that she was shivering; no, not shivering, but being shaken. The floor was
                    quivering, and, echoing in the depths of the darkness, footsteps

                    \Product[TSR 8484]{The Sword of the Dales}, the legendary leader of
                    \Place{Daggerdale}, \NPC{Randal Morn}, was captured by unknown assailants as
                    he sought to regain the great weapon for which that adventure was named. A
                    stalwart band of young and enthusiastic heroes was recruited to ride to his
                    aid, yet all they recovered was the \Item[The Sword of the Dales]{Sword}
                    itself and a message: 'Seek me in \Place[Spiderhaunt Woods]{Spiderhaunt
                    Wood}'. In the second part of the trilogy, \Product[TSR 9485]{The Secret of
                    Spiderhaunt}, those same adventurers found \NPC[Randal Morn]{Randal} and
                    freed him briefly, yet he was almost as quickly torn from their grasp by an
                    agent of the evil \Group{Zhentarim}, seeking to end the threat of \NPC{Randal
                    Morn}'s return to power.
                    In this final episode, the heroes must follow the kidnapper's trail and
                    rescued \NPC{Randal Morn} before the \Group{Zhentarim} finish interrogating
                    him and the axe falls upon his neck. Armed with the \Item[The Sword of the
                    Dales]{Sword of the Dales} and aided by a powerful magical spirit that lives
                    within the weapon, the heroes must march into the heart of \Group{Zhent}
                    occupied \Place{Dagger Falls}, free \NPC{Randal Morn}, and save the city from
                    utter destruction. The job is dangerous---perhaps more than the heroes can
                    handle---yet those who would live in songs and legends cannot concern
                    themselves with living to a ripe old age!
                    This is the final part of a trilogy of modules that began with \Product[TSR
                    9484]{The Sword of the Dales} and \Product[TSR 9485]{The Secret of
                    Spiderhaunt}.".

  description       "\emph{Ask the average dull peasant when and where the \Event[The Battle of
                    Bones]{Battle of Bones} took place and likely he will scratch his head and
                    stammer that it was in the year 1090 Dale Reckoning, at a battlefield
                    bordering on the southwest edge of \Place{Anauroch}, the \Place{Great
                    Desert}. And that afterwards, the \Monster[Human]{humans} and their allies
                    camped on the slopes of the \Place{Hill of Lost Souls}, which has since been
                    abandoned to all but the spirits of the fallen.
                    As if great wars erupted full-blown and ceased again in an instant's time! As
                    if the places so named had no meaning before or after their enrollment in the
                    savage carnage and waste we call war!}
                    So begin \NPC{Rolanda Invenweigh}'s and \NPC{Tharnn Greenwinter}'s treatise
                    on the regions surrounding these two famous sites. These individual were
                    hand-picked by \NPC{Elminster} himself to share everything they know about
                    these two places, revealing tidbits of information about the land itself and
                    its inhabitants today---information that just might save the life of an
                    adventurer or two.
                    Between these covers are expansion booklets for the \Product[TSR
                    1111]{Elminster's Ecologies} series, containing:

                    {a complete set of encounter charts}
                    These materials follows the same format as the original \Product[TSR

                    perfectly. \NPC{Elminster} himself has even thrown in a few personal
                    notes. So read on, traveler, and learn all the secrets of these mysterious
                    locales!".

                    \Place[Dales]{Dale}, though one may look the same as

                    \Place{Forgotten Realms} campaign discover their characters' roots and
                    reflect them in role-playing. Special benefits and disadvantages related to
                    each particular home town or territory allow players to create unique kits
                    that can be applied to mages, specialist wizards, and rogues, and they can
                    even be layered over other kits. As a bonus, two new player character

                    absurd than kicking a sleeping \Monster[Dragon]{dragon} in the nose for
                    sport. Even so, you've returned for another trip to the
                    \Place[Undermountain]{Underhalls}, so be prepared. You stand to enter the
                    \Place{Lost Level} this time---gird yourselves for diplomacy as well as
                    destruction. You'll find the last stronghold of an extinct
                    \Monster[Dwarf]{dwarven} clan---do be good enough to extend the greetings of
                    the \NPC[Khelben 'Blackstaff' Arunsun]{Blackstaff} to \NPC{Bandaerl}. There's
                    also a dark \Monster[Vampire]{vampiress} who enjoys a good hunt, and be sure
                    to mind the \Monster[Beholder]{beholders}---they're trained to keep you from
                    escaping. Enjoy, and don't say \NPC[Khelben 'Blackstaff' Arunsun]{Khelben}
                    didn't warn thee.
                    This \Product[TSR 9519]{Dungeon Crawl} adventure includes 32 pages of combat

                    easily be inserted into a campaign on any world, but best fits an

                    who have shed their lifeblood on the fields of battle. It's also home to

                    Take a trip to \Place{Hlondeth}, the \Monster[Yuan-ti]{yuan-ti} city that
                    stands like an emerald beacon over the waters of \Place[Vilhon

                    not all is as it appears.

                    a full-color poster map of the \Place{Vilhon Reach} as well as new artwork

                    is this: Don't. There's precious few treasures worth the death and agony and
                    fear you'll face. Your problems are twofold: First, ye've walked its halls
                    before, and \NPC[Halaster Blackcloak]{Halaster} pays attention to those who
                    visit him frequently (and he's the one you don't want to have watching
                    you!). Second, you're looking for the lair of that lunatic wizard-murderer
                    from \Place{Trades Ward}. He's a dangerous lot, that \NPC{Maddgoth}, and many
                    others met their ends by underestimating that pasty-faced little
                    scarecrow. If you're looking to lay siege to \Place{Maddgoth's Castle},
                    you're on your own---I've not visited it, and I'm not likely to,
                    either. Truth be told, no adventurer I've heard of looked for
                    \NPC{Maddgoth}'s lair and returned to tell of it.
                    'Not that this scares bold heroes such as ye be, right? Well, the path to
                    fame allows fools and champions alike, though fools often listen better than
                    heroes. Until out coins are shared again, good fortune.'

                    This \Product[TSR 9528]{Dungeon Crawl} adventure returns once again to the
                    hallowed halls of \Place{Undermountain} and into an adventure like those AD&D

                    When the heroes enter the haunted keep, they meet a terrifying trio of

  description       "\large{\Place{Calimshan} and the \Place{Lake of Steam} Revealed!}
                    The dusty trails from the \Place{North} have brought you to the warm and
                    welcoming coasts of the \Place{Shining Sea} and the \Place{Lake of
                    Steam}. Here is history spanning millennia, not just centuries; passion,
                    profit and danger; dreams of power and conquest; and wonders and mysteries
                    centuries older than any hedge realm north of \Place{Dalagar's Road} and the
                    \Place{Snowflake Mountains}.
                    \Product[TSR 9561]{Empires of the Shining Sea} goes farther and deeper into
                    the southern reaches of the \Place{Forgotten Realms} \Product[TSR
                    1085]{campaign setting}, providing a breadth of scope and a level of detail
                    never before published. This boxed set includes a 192-page book filled with
                    information on these topics:
                    \list
                    {\bold{History}
                    The \Place{Empires of the Shining Sea} hold tales and legends passed
                    down by word of mouth across the years. The myriad of mysteries and
                    dramas of more than 300 rulers across four empires---including the
                    infamous \Place{Shoon Imperium}---reveal themselves in the history and
                    timeline spanning more than 8'000 years.}
                    {\bold{\Place{Calimshan}}
                    The long-fallen empire of \Place{Calimshan} rises yet again, as a new
                    ruler and new power groups take control of the former land of the
                    \Monster[Genie]{genies}. Updated and expanded by more than 100 pages
                    since its first appearance in FR3, \Product[TSR 9224]{Empires of the
                    Sands}, \Place{Calimshan} shows itself to be a land bent on returning
                    to its former greatness---at any and all costs!}
                    {\bold{The \Place{Land of the Lions}}
                    This rugged land sandwiched between the \Place{Deepwash} and the
                    \Place[Lake of Steam]{lake of Steam} seems empty, but many surprises
                    lurk among its plains and woods---nomads and raiders astride
                    \Monster[Giant Lynx]{giant lynxes}, \Monster[Elder Orb]{elder orbs},
                    ruined cities, lost cultures, and more!}
                    {\bold{The \Place{Lake of Steam}}
                    The steaming bay of the \Place{Shining Sea} unveils its secrets,
                    proving that it holds more than easy trade routes to the \Place{Inner
                    Sea}. Scarlet pearls the size of a \Monster[Human]{human} fist or the
                    smoking majesty of the volcanic \Place{Arnrock} tempt those who dare
                    test its deceptively calm waters.}
                    Also inside are two full-color poster maps showing \Place{Calimshan} and the
                    \Place{Lake of Steam} region at 30-mile-per-inch scale.
                    Everything you need to adventure in the conspiracy laden \Product[TSR
                    9561]{Empires of the Shining Sea} is here!".

  description       "\Place{Hellgate Keep}---a name that once made the boldest of heroes shudder
                    in fear---was long ago known as the fair citadel of \Place{Ascalhorn}, a
                    haven for \Monster[Elf]{elves} and \Monster[Human]{humans}. Then a
                    \Monster[Demon]{demonic} horde of \Monster[Baatezu]{baatezu} and
                    \Monster[Tanar'ri]{tanar'ri} destroyed all remnants of real civilization and
                    turned it into a den of malevolence. Today, the citadel lies ruined. The
                    \NPC{Mistmaster} and the \Group{Harpers} destroyed the keep and ended its
                    centuries-long reign of evil in the autumn of the Year of the Gauntlet (1369
                    DR)...or so they believed.
                    With the coming of the following spring, many scavengers streamed to the
                    \Place{Upvale} to uncover treasures and artifacts long hidden by the
                    \Monster[Tanar'ri]{tanar'ri} of \Place{Hellgate Keep}. They went forth
                    assuming they could find easy plunder. They were wrong.
                    Prepare to meet a new race of creatures spawned both of \Place{Faer\hat{u}n}
                    and the \Place{Lower Planes}. Uncover the corruption of an
                    \Monster[Elf]{elven} house that was ancient before \Place{Myth Drannor} ever
                    rose. Find out what survived the havoc visited upon the \Place[Hellgate
                    Keep]{Keep}, and who or what leads the survivors to a new lair. All this and
                    more awaits amid the depths of ruined \Place{Hellgate Keep}!
                    This stand-alone 32-page adventure is set within the northern wilderness of
                    the \Place[Forgotten Realms]{Realms}. It easily fits within an existing
                    \Place{Forgotten Realms} \Product[TSR 1085]{campaign}, though it can also be
                    incorporated into any other AD&D campaign world with minor modifications.".

                    imprisoned on a far plane of existence by some great evil.
                    The leader of \God{Waukeen}'s church believes that these visions mean
                    \God{Waukeen} is alive but trapped in the deadly and dangerous

                    other, creating new opportunities for player characters and extending the

  description       "Every corner of \Place{Faer\hat{u}n} harbors its own sinister element. When
                    opportunities arise, malevolent groups and nefarious individuals emerge from
                    the shadows to make their infamous marks on the \Place{Realms}. Within these
                    pages, you will discover everything players and Dungeon Masters need to
                    create the most evil organizations, treacherous villains, and morally
                    ambiguous antiheroes to ever afflict the \Place{Forgotten Realms} game
                    setting.
                    \list
                    {3 new races}
                    {Over 30 new spells}

                    Everything you need to know to play evil or morally ambiguous characters in
                    the \Place{Forgotten Realms} setting.
                    \Product{Champions of Ruin} is a comprehensive guide to playing evil
                    characters in the \Place{Forgotten Realms} setting. Many aspects of play are
                    covered: vengeance, ambition, evil vs. evil, corruption and moral failure,
                    loyalty and betrayal. The book also discusses types of evil -- lawful,
                    chaotic, and neutral -- as well as morally ambivalent characters such as
                    anti-heroes and rogues. Elder evils of extreme power are discussed along with
                    tools, feats, spells, evil places and planar touchstones, and guilds and
                    organizations that evil characters can join. Two new races are also
                    introduced.".

                    \NPC{Duskwalker}, an ancient and corrupt star \Monster{elf}
                    \Class{wizard}. Missing travelers and lost goods all point to a circle of
                    standing stones within the forest. Perhaps, like its counterparts elsewhere
                    in the \Place{Yuirwood}, this stone henge allows for travel to another
                    place---but where? And what growing darkness awaits those bold enough
                    to find out?
                    \Product{The Twilight Tomb} is a stand-alone DUNGEONS & DRAGONS adventure
                    designed to take four 3rd-level characters from the sun-dappled paths of the
                    \Place{Yuirwood} into a realm created by a bygone betrayal. Although the
                    adventure is set in the \Place{Aglarond} region of \Place{Faer\hat{u}n}, it
                    can easily be placed in any D&D campaign.";
