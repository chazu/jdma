                    scheme from ancient tunnels beneath the volcano, stoking it once more to
                    terrible life. To prevent their agenda, your band of adventurers must brave
                    haunted jungle ruins, slay mighty \Monster[dragon]{dragons}, and bind
                    themselves to a layer of the infinite \Place{Abyss}. Will their swords and
                    spell be enough to save the \Place{Shackled City}?
                    Originally published as 11 linked adventures in the award-winning

                    most ambitious official Dungeons & Dragons campaign ever created. Now, for
                    the first time ever, everything you need to play the campaign has been
                    compiled into a deluxe 416-page full-color hardcover that also includes an
                    8-panel fully detailed map booklet, and a brand new \Place{Shackled City}
                    adventure written by fan favorite author Christopher Perkins.
                    To use this Adventure Path, a Dungeon Master also needs the \Product{Player's
                    Handbook} and \Product{Dungeon Master;s Guide} published by Wizards of the

                    into the mountain, lower and lower into the bowels of the ancient, forbidding
                    halls of long-dead \Monster[Dwarf]{dwarves}. The torchlight flickers,
                    threatening to succumb to the oppressive darkness. Creeping along one
                    striated granite wall, \NPC{Arikus} the warrior moves cautiously toward the
                    great cavern ahead, its sides and walls disappearing into the gloomy
                    distance. Cocking his head to one side to listen, he holds his hand up for a
                    moment, demanding unconditional quiet from his companions. Then, his arm
                    relaxing in relief, he waves everyone forward and moves into the open. Before
                    him, scattered to the far walls of the enormous cavern, are piles upon piles
                    of glittering treasure---coins from countless kingdoms, sparkling gems,
                    exquisite jewelry, and items of wondrous power---enough for twenty kings'
                    ransoms. \NPC{Arikus} laughs gleefully, thrusting both hands into the nearest
                    cache of coins to let them run through his fingers. At that moment, a
                    monstrous shadow looms threateningly over him. Looking up, \NPC{Arikus}
                    blanches and stumbles back in horror before the terrible visage of a
                    \Monster[Red Dragon]{Great Red Wyrm}. The fearsome \Monster[Dragon]{dragon}
                    opens its razor-filled maw and spews forth a gout of white-hot flame,
                    engulfing the hapless warrior...}
                    The ultimate Dungeon Master fantasy! This is \emph{the} most deluxe dungeon,
                    designed to appeal to discriminating and demanding role-players. Adventurers,
                    beware. This is more than just a \Monster[Dragon]{dragon} hunt. Within the
                    lair of this beast lie cruel and deadly traps, befuddling conundrums and
                    puzzles, and cunning minions that will be the end of overconfident or

                    to create dramatic settings for their adventures. Players can use Cardmaster
                    to go a-questing without a DM. Even solo adventures are possible, just by
                    shuffling the cards.
                    108 Location Cards depict unique and mysterious rooms and corridors on three
                    dungeon levels. And on all levels are treasures to be found and monsters to
                    be conquered. The Treasure Deck contains 54 cards full of loot and magical
                    items. Explore each room for treasure, but beware the traps! And beware the
                    54 different monsters with their own traps and snares, nesting in their own
                    Deck. They are waiting for you...and some of them are hungry.".

                    pleasant land of \Place{Haranshire}.

                    \Place{Underdark}, shifts the scene to the underground as the characters
                    search the seemingly endless realm of the \Place[Underdark]{underdark} to
                    discover the fate of the kidnappers' victims. By the time they reach the dark
                    cavern of \Place{The Sunless Sea} in Book III, they should be each 10th level
                    or above, ready at last to confront the ultimate evil behind the far-reaching
                    conspiracy.

                    Imagine a place of unspeakable evil. It was built upon hopelessness and
                    filled with unending terror and pain. This loathsome place shattered the life
                    of everyone who venture near. But through tremendous sacrifice and heroism,
                    over the course of many years, it was finally gutted and its foul creator
                    destroyed.
                    Now imagine that the horror is beginning all over again.
                    The sinister wizard \NPC{Acererak} took great pains to safeguard his tomb. It
                    took many years, and many more lives, before his evil was finally laid to
                    rest. But though the \Monster{demilich} is gone, he is not forgotten. Others
                    would become as he was have traveled to the site of \NPC{Acererak}'s tomb
                    seeking the secrets of mastery over death. Slowly these pilgrims gathered,
                    eventually building in the shadow of the tomb itself a cummunity dedicated to
                    the dark arts: \Place{Skull City}.
                    But even these twisted necromancers have no inkling to the true evil that
                    swells and crackles beneath their feet.
                    This boxed adventure contains:
                    \list
                    {a 160-page adventure book;}
                    {a 32-page book of illustrations to be shown to players;}
                    {player handouts, including an adventurer's diary filled with clues;}

  description       "Take your spellcasters to the limits they have never reached before! With
                    over two hundred new spells and magical items, the \Product{Tome of Magic}
                    stretches the horizons of every wizard and priest in the AD&D 2nd Edition
                    game.
                    In these pages are new forms of wizard magic including elementalists,
                    metamagic, and wild magic, plus expansions of existing schools. For priests,
                    whole new spheres have be discovered---spheres of chaos, law, numbers,
                    thought, time, war, and wards---and powerful new quest spells lie waiting to
                    be tapped.
                    All characters will experience the thrill of discovering new magical items
                    such as the \Item{claw of magic stealing}, \Item{dimensional mine},
                    \Item{crystal parrot}, \Item{ring of randomness}, and \Item{staff of the
                    elements}. \Product{Tome of Magic} is an invaluable expansion for all the
                    spellcasting classes!".

                    brought together in this first release in an annual series of Monstrous
                    Compendium supplements.
                    This book is crawling with more than 100 denizens of the land, sky, sea, and
                    underdark, waiting to creep into the nearest adventure. Creatures within
                    these pages have appeared in the \Place{Forgotten Realms} campaign setting,
                    the \Place{Al-Qadim} world of adventure, the \Place{Ravenloft} world of
                    horror, the \Place{Dark Sun} game world, and even the \Place{Outer} and
                    \Place{Inner Planes}, but they've all been reorganized, updated, and edited
                    so they can be used in any campaign. An introduction explaining how to
                    breathe life into random encounters is included too.
                    Every illustration is brand new and presented in full color, so these
                    monsters are more lifelike then ever before! This is a must-have item for all
                    serious Dungeon Masters.".

  description       "Back again, and better than ever! Virtually all new AD&D game monsters that
                    were published by TSR in 1994 have growled, burrowed, and slithered their way
                    into this second release in a yearly series of Monstrous Compendium
                    supplements.
                    More than 100 denizens of land, sky, sea, and ... other places ... are
                    collected inside. Most of these creatures originally appeared in a specific
                    AD&D campaign setting, but they've all been updated and edited so they can be
                    used in any campaign.
                    This year's collection also features the return of long out-of-print
                    \Monster{dinosaurs} and \Monster{pleistocene creatures}, and includes general
                    encounter tables for the Monstrous Compendium books.
                    This richly illustrated book is an essential addition to every Dungeon
                    Master's library.".

                    enjoyment of the AD&D game. It accomplishes much of the 'work' of the game
                    and allows you to enjoy creative play with a number of tools to assist you
                    along the way.
                    The product is divided into three major sections: \emph{Player Character}
                    aids in the creation and upkeep of player characters; \emph{Book On Line}
                    provides a quick, easy way to find and manipulate information about the game
                    system; and the \emph{DM Toolkit} offers utilities to assist in the creation
                    of fun and interesting adventures. In addition to these three main sections,
                    the \emph{Village Tour} presents a short, animated AD&D adventure.
                    \Product{Core Rules} is based primarily on the game system as explained in
                    the \Product{Player's Handbook} and \Product{Dungeon Master Guide}. This is
                    supplemented by the \Product{Monstrous Manual} tome, \Product{Arms and
                    Equipment Guide}, and \Product{Tome of Magic}. Here you will find the core of
                    the game system from which everything else derives.".

                    \Place{Dark Sun}, \Place{Red Steel}, and \Place{Greyhawk} settings (and a few
                    have just sprung from the fertile minds of their creators).
                    This collection, which is fully indexed, features new monsters from the
                    \Place{Far Realm}, and includes many creatures suitable for nautical and
                    undersea adventures.".

                    designed as an instructional module to help novice Dungeon Masters design

                    This module contains maps and background material for the \Place{Isle},
                    fifteen new monsters, and suggestions for further adventures. In addition,

                    itself. In this module, players will push their way through dark jungles and
                    treacherous swamps to discover the lost plateau, and the final secrets
                    of---the Isle of Dread!

  description       "The most deadly dungeon ever designed! High-level characters brave the
                    unexplored corridors of \Place{Deepearth} to confront perhaps the most feared
                    adversary in the AD&D game.
                    The second chapter of the \Product{Bloodstone Pass} saga follows the
                    conclusion of the desperate war against the bandit army. A cold and bitter
                    winter drives the villagers to the edge of starvation, and numerous horrors
                    strike the town of \Place{Bloodstone Pass}.
                    Join the adventure as the heroes explore the depths of the ancient
                    \Place{bloodstone mines}, now inhabited by fearsome \Monster{demon}s. There
                    they hope to uncover the fantastic treasures rumored to exist in the unknown
                    darkness. But deep within the mines, all is not what it seems...
                    This module uses the new rules from the \Product{Dungeoneer's Survival Guide}
                    and \Product{Wilderness Survival Guide}. THe adventure also includes optional
                    \Product{Battlesystem} scenarios fought entirely underground. These
                    supplementary products are not required to play the adventure, however.";

                    If you have \Product{The Bookd of Lairs}, you already know what you'll find
                    herein. These mini-adventures are arranged by terrain type (city, desert,
                    hills, mountains, forest, etc.), with monsters in alphabetical order for easy
                    access. At the back of the book is a combined monsters statistics table,
                    showing all the necessary figures at a glance.
                    These are familiar monsters (like the \Monster{gnome}, \Monster{brownie}, and
                    \Monster{ettin}) and not-so-familiar ones (like the \Monster{bakemono} and
                    \Monster{tengu}), from both original AD&D sources and the \Product{Oriental
                    Adventures} book. Some of these mini-adventures are mere diversions; others
                    can turn into minor campaigns! In any case, DMs and players alike are sure to
                    be pleased with \Product{The Book of Lairs II}.";

  description       "Decades ago, \Place{Sturnheim} was a thriving trade town on a major caravan
                    route. But then, disaster struck when a gold-laden caravan disappeared
                    without a trace. Financially ruined, the town slipped into decline, and now
                    lies almost forgotten on a route that is seldom traveled anymore.
                    \Product{Fighter's Challenge} is a new type of Advanced Dungeons & Dragons
                    adventure. It is designed especially for a Dungeon Master and one
                    player---perfect for very small playing groups, for those times when the
                    whole group can't get together, or for the player who wants his character to
                    earn some extra experience. This adventure will provide hours of excitement
                    for the DM and any \Class{warrior} or multi-class \Class{fighter} characters
                    of levels 2 to 4.
                    You can unravel a 40-year-old mystery and restore the honor of
                    \Place{Sturnheim}---if you have the guts!";

  description       "The village of \Place{Northbank} was once a heaven for mages of all talents
                    and a magnet for hopeful apprentices. Its wizards' guild was a respected
                    center for instruction, study, and research. But mysterious circumstances
                    caused the sudden demise of the guild several years ago and resulted in the
                    deaths of some important members. And a ghostly figure now threatens the few
                    surviving member of the guild.
                    \Product{Wizards Challenge} is an Advanced Dungeons & Dragons adventure
                    designed for a single character or a party of up to three members. It allows
                    a wizard to be the center of the adventure and offers many role-playing
                    opportunities such as spell research, component gathering, and forging
                    important relationships with other wizards. This adventure is perfect for the
                    wizard who needs experience, is looking for something more than crawling
                    through dungeons, or is seeking a student or mentor.
                    Is your character ready to accept the challenge? Intrigue and danger await!";

                    characters from mountaintops to the ocean depths. The player characters can
                    find treasure drowned in deep water, watch the stars for omens, rescue a
                    kidnapped prince, search for a list mine, visit a very strange restaurant, or
                    explore the sky-temple of a forgotten deity. But beware! The greater the
                    treasure-hoard, the greater the danger from its guardians.
                    Each adventure comes with two beautifully rendered full color maps, one for
                    the players and one for the Dungeon Master. Also provided are rumors
                    associated with each map and encounter notes for the DM. These adventures are
                    adaptable for play in any AD&D game world, either as a brief encounter or as
                    the start of a full-fledged campaign. The DM can also use any of the 32
                    full-color maps to create adventures of his or her own.";

                    called upon a wizard to solve what his soldiers could not. Can the skills of
                    one player character wizard let him find and kill what a contingent of
                    skilled warriors could not?
                    \Product{Wizard's Challenge II} is an Advanced Dungeons & Dragons adventure
                    designed for a Dungeon Master and one player character wizard. This adventure
                    is the sixths in a series of adventures focusing on an individual character
                    away from a regular campaign. A character will need all of the knowledge and
                    skills available only to a wizard if he is to succeed.";

                    extensive details on urban settings that player characters are likely to
                    visit in any campaign. For instance, there's:
                    \list
                    {A smithy run by \Monster{gnomes}}
                    {A temple that's home to an orphaned dragon}
                    {A tavern that patrons can't enter until they give the password}
                    This book also describes two inns, a singing fountain, a jail, and much more!
                    Each site's entry tells the Dungeon Master what the place looks like at first
                    glance and offers a detailed floorplan of the interior as well as a picture
                    of the exterior. Readers also find fascinating notes about the characters who
                    live and work in each site, and one or two ideas for personalizing the spot
                    to suite any adventure.
                    From now on, make a trip to the city easy---and exciting!

                    \Product{Jakandor, Land of Legend} brings the epic struggle of the
                    \Product{Jakandor Odyssey trilogy} to its startling climax. The \Group{Knorr}
                    and the \Group{Charonti} are embroiled in a blood feud to claim ownership of
                    their island home: Here are the legendary battles that will either unite the
                    two nations or destroy them.
                    The product presents an anthology of adventures and the tools to run an
                    exciting campaign in this land of feuding barbarians and wizards. Additional
                    sites, details of \Place{Jakandor}'s wilderness, and expanded random
                    encounter charts are part of the package. A full-color map features the first
                    true view of the island, combining the \Group{Knorr} east with the
                    \Group{Charonti} west.
                    The adventures, adaptable to either society, allow players to explore both
                    the \Group{Knorrman} and \Group{Charonti} cultures. Included is a scenario to
                    help DMs add \Place{Jakandor} to their existing AD&D campaigns, as well as a
                    large adventure that explores an extensive underground ruin. Finally, rules
                    are presented for battles between the gigantic magical constructs of both
                    cultures.".

                    The barbarians who call themselves the \Group{Knorr}, driven from their
                    homeland, wanted nothing but freedom and an honorable existence when they
                    landed on the shores of \Place{Jakandor}. What they found was an island
                    occupied by despicable wielders of vile magic---the \Group{Broken People}, as
                    the \Group{Knorr} call them, who rely on legions of animated corpses to do
                    their fighting. These enemies represent everything the \Group{Knorr} find
                    hateful and dishonorable, and no clansman will rest until the last of the
                    \Group{Broken People} has tasted \Group{Knorrman} steel.

                    War} a fresh experience for all players, novices and veterans alike.".

  description       "\large{Evil Denizens of the Depths: the \Monster{Sahuagin}.}
                    The \Monster{Sahuagin} are known by many names. Some call them the
                    \Monster{Devil Men of the Deep}; to others, they are simply the \Monster{Sea
                    Devils}. This deadly race of aquatic beings has remained a mystery to
                    surfacedwellers---until now. This fully illustrated 96-page accessory details
                    the highly organized structure of \Monster{sahuagin} society, offers insight
                    into the workings of the predatory \Monster{sahuagin} mind, and examines the
                    worship of \God{Sekolah}, the dark \Monster{sahuagin} deity.
                    \Product{The Sea Devils} also includes a full description of a typical
                    \Monster{sahuagin} village easily usable in any campaign setting, new spells
                    that are granted to \Monster{sahuagin} priestesses, and a color poster
                    detailing the \Monster{sahuagin} in all their variety.
                    This book is the second in a series of accessories that focuses on some of
                    the most popular monsters in the AD&D game. DMs and players alike should also
                    look for \Product{Evil Tide}, \Product{Night of the Shark}, and \Product{Sea
                    of Blood}, a trilogy of \Product{Monstrous Arcana} adventures centered around
                    \Monster{sahuagin}.".

                    When the sun sinks low, the \Monster{sea devils} rise dripping from the dark
                    waves. They swarm like \Monster{sharks}, lethal and unstoppable. Death glints
                    like a promise in their rabid eyes, and the blood of their prey paints their
                    claws and teeth scarlet.
                    Night after night they come, slaying all who stand in their way. Their sudden
                    raids have devastated the island, bringing fishing and commerce to a halt as
                    the people cower in their homes, dreading the next sunset. Desperate, the
                    \NPC{Potentate of Angleburg} has sent for help from daring adventurers
                    willing to face the \Monster{devil men of the deep}. But more secrets lurk
                    beneath the waves: this is no passing attack but part of a more sinister,
                    secret design by the most dangerous and capable race to inhabit the dark
                    seas.
                    \Product{Evil Tide} is the first of an adventure trilogy (continuing with
                    \Product{Night of the Shark} and concluding in \Product{Sea of Blood}) that
                    pits brave adventurers against the evil race called '\Monster{sahuagin}' by
                    the air-breathing races. The \Monster{sahuagin} adventure trilogy can be
                    played separately or linked together to form a seamless epic-length
                    adventure. The \Monster{sahuagin} trilogy supports \Product{Sea Devils}, a
                    \Product{Monstrous Arcana} source book providing invaluable, fascinating, and
                    immediately applicable supplementary information.".

                    building advice, approaches, and tactics gathered over many years. The
                    suggestions and samples in this book are an invaluable resource for

                    imagination.

                    in here may be old news to you, even the most experienced Dungeon Master is
                    sometimes strapped for time or inspiration. \Product{Dungeon Builder's

                    notice, the \Monster{goblin} warren the PCs accidentally stumble upon, or the
                    pocket dimension you did not get a chance to detail.

                    tables to help you flesh out your dungeon.}
                    {A collection of 78 geomorphs that you can photocopy, trace, or freehand
                    onto your own maps.}
                    {The Trap Architect, a detailed process for generating lethal traps.}

                    make out a misshapen head from which depended a writhing, coiling cluster of
                    slick tentacles.
                    As I opened my mouth to give warning of the true enemy, I felt a scratch
                    cross the surface of my mind...}

                    Only one vile force could cause such chaos: The \Monster{Illithids} have rise
                    up once again, ready to enslave the surface races. Now, as never before, the

                    The \Monster{illithids} once ruled a mighty empire that stretched across many
                    worlds. These foul creatures enslaved or destroyed whole races in their quest

                    \Monster{mind flayer} empire toppled, and the multiverse was freed from
                    eternal servitude.
                    Now, a hundred suns burn toward extinction, their light stolen by the
                    \Monster{flayers} to reinvent their past. If the PCs do not stop the new

                    once again! Following the clues left by their benefactor, the adventurers
                    journey over a vast world of ancient ruins. Buried deeply within these ruins
                    lies an artifact of ancient \Monster{illithid} manufacture. This item is all
                    that stands between the \Monster{illithids} and their nefarious goal:
                    complete and utter domination.

                    Cahervaniel} have stood lonely vigil on a grassy hilltop. Sheepherders once
                    moved their flocks over the hill and through the circle, sometimes resting in
                    the cool shadows cast by the ancient stones.
                    Everything changed when a stone finger fell, revealing a fissure in the
                    earth. Now, dark shadows caress the circle after the sun sets. Creatures out
                    of nightmare dance upon the hillsides at night. Many swear that a
                    \Monster{unicorn} of deepest ebony now hunts all upon two legs who draw near,
                    while stunted creatures scurry in the shadows, abducting sheep from their
                    sheds and drawing them down below ground for food.
                    After the disappearance of a shepherd, fear grows stronger in neighboring

                    Now, almost twenty years later, the \Place{Keep} has declined into a sleepy
                    outpost settlement. The trained warriors once stationed here and the

                    once again stirs in the fabled \Place{Caves of Chaos}. Humanoids, undead, and
                    evil minions of a dark goddess plot to destroy their enemies. Only novice
                    adventurers who have come to try their hand at dungeon delving in this
                    traditional training spot stand in their way.

                    mad advance into the lair!}
                    Welcome to \Product{Reverse Dungeon}, the adventure where everything is
                    backward! Instead of playing bold heroes who venture into dens of evil, the
                    players take the roles of the monsters, determined to stop adventurers from
                    invading their homes. Instead of always being the good guys, the players get
                    a chance to be the bad guys.
                    \Product{Reverse Dungeon} contains three linked minicampaigns in which the
                    players represent:
                    \list
                    {\Monster{Goblins} whose warrens are under siege from a band of heroes
                    seeking fame and fortune;}
                    {Guardian abominations whose vaults are attacked from several
                    directions at once; and}
                    {Ancient undead that must defend the silence of their tomb against
                    crusading clerics intent on destroying them.}
                    Enter the \Product{Reverse Dungeon}---and find out how it feels to be on the
                    receiving end of a hero's blade.".

                    make die rolls without showing everyone else the results. What players will
                    see is a striking piece of artwork that will put them in the mood for
                    adventuring.
                    You also get an eight-page booklet that includes more tables, plus some

                    A hideous death cult has seized control of an ancient artifact-monument known
                    as \Place{Tovag Baragu}. The power behind the cult is the \God{Old One}
                    himself, \God{Iuz the Evil}, demonic master of an empire. He's on an
                    all-or-nothing quest for supremacy over the world---and the heavens beyond.
                    To stop him, heroes must face horrors never dreamed of, journeying to a
                    shadowed city where \God{Death} rules and the living cower. Here, \God{Iuz}
                    will achieve his mad dream by destroying the imprisoned master of that alien
                    citadel---\NPC{Vecna}, the mightiest \Monster{lich}, an inmmortal demigod.
                    Two items exist with the power to stop \God{Iuz}---the \Item{Eye} and the
                    \Item{Hand of \NPC{Vecna}}---but using them carries fantastic risks. Not even
                    the gods know what will be unleashed when these items are fully activated.
                    \Product{Die Vecna Die!} takes the heroes from the \Product{Greyhawk}
                    campaign to the demiplane of \Product{Ravenloft} and then to the
                    \Product{Planescape} city of \Place{Sigil}. However, none of the material

  description       "Some heroes find weapons of legacy, while other forge them. Unlike other
                    magic items, a weapon of legacy gains new abilities as its wielder becomes
                    more powerful. In the hands of a true hero, a simple sword might achieve fame
                    and power as great as that of the dark blade \Item{Exordius}, the
                    wizard-hating \Item{Hammer of Witches}, or the skull-shattering
                    \Item{morningstar} known as \Item{Mindsplinter}.
                    This supplement for the D&D game describes nearly 50 items of legacy. Each
                    item has its own character, a detailed history, special wielder requirements,
                    unique powers, and adventure seeds. \Product{Weapons of Legacy} provides
                    rules and tools for players and DMs to forge new items of legacy for their
                    characters or campaigns, along with new legacy feats, spells, a prestige
                    class, and psionic powers for characters interested in wielding mythic
                    weapons and other items of power.
                    The ultimate guide to magic items -- especially weapons -- of rich heritage.
                    \Product{Weapons of Legacy} provides a wealth of information on magical
                    weapons with rich histories. The book includes many pre-defined weapons,
                    outlining their names, history, powers, stats, necessary rituals for
                    unlocking their powers, and adventure hooks. How the weapons can gain power
                    is discussed, as well as the feats with which they might be used. Also
                    included are discussions of other magic items such as magic armor, rings, and
                    staves.".

  description       "\large{Conquer the Maelstrom}
                    Sometimes an adventure takes an aquatic turn. You might find yourself
                    exploring an ancient city lost beneath the waves, navigating an underground
                    river plagued by monsters, plotting a course to some stormwracked isle, or
                    battling pirates on the high seas. Well, fear not, brave adventurer. Here is
                    your ride to overcoming such perils!
                    This supplement examines marine environments, from flooded dungeons and
                    subterranean seas to mystical island and the gloomy deep. It provides rules
                    for adapting to, navigating through, and surviving hazardous seaborne,
                    underwater, and stormwracked conditions. This book also includes new
                    character options (races, spells, psionic powers, feats, and prestige
                    classes), magic items and monsters associated with sea and storms, adventure
                    sites, and a narrative ship-to-ship combat system.
                    The third in a series of beautifully illustrated supplements focusing on
                    play in specific environmental climes, \Product{Maelstrom} contains rules on
                    play in watery environments. Not only are rules for sea campaigns offered,
                    but rules for including water environments in land-based D&D campaigns and
                    dungeon adventures are also covered.
                    Included is extensive information on lakes and rivers; hazards such as
                    exposure, storms, and waterspouts; races, including non-aquatic races
                    associated with the sea; equipment, including detailed deck plans for ships;
                    monsters; magic, including psionic elements; skills; feats; and more.".

  description       "Great conflicts erupt between rival nations and threaten to sweep across
                    entire continents. As armies clash in epic battles, the actions of a handful
                    of bold heroes can turn the tide of war. Whether in the thick of combat or on
                    a secret mission of dire importance, brave champions have an impact that
                    echoes across the battlefield and resounds through the ages.
                    This supplement for the D&D game reveals the pivotal roles characters can
                    play in the midst of great battles. With rules and options for creating or
                    playing adventures on and around battlefields, Heroes of Battle plunges
                    characters into wartime situations and challenges them with climactic battles
                    of epic proportions.
                    To use this supplement, a Dungeon Master also needs the \Product{Player's
                    Handbook} and \Product{Dungeon Master's Guide}. A player needs
                    only the \Product{Player's Handbook}.
                    Heroes of Battle provides everything one needs to know to play a
                    battle-oriented D&D campaign. You can build military characters with new
                    feats, spells, uses for traditional spells, and prestige classes. Information
                    is given on tools specific to the battlefield, including siege engines,
                    weapons, magic items, steeds, and other exotic mounts. Battlefield terrain
                    aspects are discussed with plenty of illustrative maps and new
                    rules. Specific types of battlefield encounters are discussed in detail, and
                    the book provides specific detail on designing battlefields.".

  description       "The \Product{Tome of Magic} supplement presents three new kinds of magic
                    that you can integrate easily into any Dungeon & Dragons campaign. These
                    magic 'subsystems' function alongside the existing D&D magic system and offer
                    new game mechanics, character options, and adventure possibilities. Within
                    this tome you'll find three new standard classes---one for each new kind of
                    magic---as well as new spells, feats, prestige classes, monsters, and magic
                    items tied thematically to each.
                    \bold{Pact Magic}
                    Powerful entities known as \Item{vestiges} exist beyond the boundaries of
                    life, death, and undeath. The \Class{binder} uses pact magic---a combination
                    of symbols and secret rituals---to summon these entities, strike bargains
                    with them, and gain their formidable and sometimes bizarre supernatural
                    powers.
                    \bold{Shadow Magic}
                    The \Place{Plane of Shadow} is a dark, twisted reflection of the real
                    world. The \Class{shadowcaster}, by understanding the fundamental properties
                    of the plane and unlocking its magical mysteries, learns to harness and
                    channel its umbral gloom, shaping the darkness to server her whim.
                    \bold{Truename Magic}
                    Every creature has a truename---the word of its creation. The
                    \Class{truenamer} knows the primal language of the universe---the language of
                    Truespeech---and learns the truenames of creatures and objects to gain
                    control over them, transform them, or destroy them.
                    Three new magic systems for any D&D campaign.
                    \Product{Tome of Magic} introduces three new magic subsystems for the D&D
                    game. Any or all of these systems can easily be inserted into a
                    campaign. Pact magic gives characters the ability to channel lost souls,
                    harnessing their abilities to gain supernatural powers. Shadow magic draws
                    power from the mysterious \Place{Plane of Shadow}. Truename magic gives
                    characters that learn and properly use the true name of a creature or object
                    immense power over it. All three systems introduce new base classes and
                    spellcasting mechanics. Also included are new feats, prestige classes, magic
                    items, and spells.";

                    up and D&D game, whether used to build a terrifying encounter, a frightening
                    adventure, or a horrific campaign. Get to the root of what really scares you,
                    the things that go bump in the night, and see what happens when the heroes of
                    D&D bump back.
                    This book provides Dungeon Masters with a toolkit for adding the elements of
                    horror to any D&D game, including tips and advice for infusing an adventure
                    with everything from creepiness to unease to nightmares and despair. It
                    features new rules to evoke a sense of dread and foreboding, new monsters and
                    templates, and ways to use existing monsters in horrific and unsettling ways.
                    For players, this book offers two new standard classes, new prestige classes,
                    feats, spells, and magic items designed to help hold off the encroaching
                    darkness for another night. From the \Class{archivist} and the \Class{dread
                    necromancer}, to the \Class{fiend-blooded} and the \Class{tainted scholar},
                    you'll discover ways to prepare your hero---or antihero---for the struggle
                    against fear itself.
                    \Product{Heroes of Horror} provides everything players and Dungeon Masters
                    need to play and run a horror-oriented campaign or integrate elements of
                    creepiness & tension into their existing campaigns. Players can develop
                    heroes or anti-heroes using new feats, new spells, new base classes and
                    prestige classes, and new magic items. The book presents new mechanics for
                    different types of horror, including rules for dread and tainted characters,
                    as well as plenty of new horrific monsters and adventure seeds. Different
                    types and genres of horror are discussed in detail.".

  description       "\large{Harness a New and Original Source of Magical Power}
                    Drawn from the ambient life energy that fills the multiverse, \Item{incarnum}
                    is the essence of all creatures. \Item{Incarnum} flows as a deep, blue,
                    radiant mist, and those with the knowledge to harness this energy can shape
                    it into objects of great power, called \Item{soulmelds}. Using
                    \Item{soulmelds} crafted from raw \Item{incarnum}, an adventurer opens up new
                    avenues of ability never available before.
                    In the tradition of the \Product{Expanded Psionics Handbook}, the
                    \Product{Magic of Incarnum} games supplement presents an alternative to
                    conventional magic that grants access to a new source of power. Characters of
                    all classes can experience \Item{incarnum} through feats, spells, psionic
                    powers, and prestige classes, while \Item{incarnum}-wielding standard classes
                    such as the \Class{incarnate} and the \Class{soulborn} allow players to take
                    full advantage of \Item{incarnum}'s amazing powers.
                    The \Product{Magic of Incarnum} games supplement includes a wealth of options
                    and advice about incorporating this new power source into ongoing or
                    brand-new campaigns.
                    This supplement introduces a magical substance called incarnum into the D&D
                    game. With this book, the players characters can meld incarnum-the
                    power of souls living, dead, and unborn-into magical items and even
                    their own bodies, granting them special attacks, defenses, and other
                    abilities (much as magic items and spells do). Incarnum can be shaped and
                    reshaped into new forms, giving characters tremendous versatility in the
                    dungeon and on any battlefield.
                    This book also features new classes, prestige classes, feats, and other
                    options for characters wishing to explore the secrets of incarnum, as well as
                    rules and advice for including incarnum in a D&D campaign.".

  description       "\emph{Deep beneath the earth, stoic \Monster[dwarf]{dwarves} spent years
                    laboring to trace and extract precious veins of mithral ore. But now they
                    face the depredations of ancient and terrible foe---cruel \Monster[drow]{dark
                    elf} raiders. To aid the \Monster[dwarf]{dwarves}, a group of daring
                    adventurers must fight though the most dangerous regions of the mithral mines
                    and into the lair of the dreaded \Monster{drow}.}
                    \Product{Fane of the Drow} is the first in the new Fantastic Locations series
                    of products. It contains two beautifully illustrated, double-sided battle
                    maps for Dungeon & Dragons play, as well as an encounter booklet. The battle
                    maps feature fantastic terrain designed to create large, fluid encounters,
                    key scenes, and exciting game sessions. Rather than simple dungeon
                    encounters, these maps generate the epic struggles that campaign memories are
                    made of.
                    The maps also make ideal battlegrounds for D&D \Product{Miniature Game}
                    play. Build your warband and fight for control of the Mithral Mines, Queen
                    Peregrine's Tomb, or the dreaded Fane of \God{Lolth}. The encounter booklet
                    includes both roleplaying game encounters and miniatures game options for use
                    with the four battle maps.
                    \Product{Fantastic Locations: Fane of the Drow} features two double-sided
                    poster maps designed for roleplaying and miniatures skirmish play. An
                    accompanying 16-page adventure can be dropped into any campaign. Enemies
                    consist of creatures from various D&D miniatures. Miniatures skirmish
                    scenarios are included for additional play options, written to allow Dungeon
                    Masters to seamlessly integrate D&D Miniatures into the adventure. The two
                    poster maps, which are scaled for tabletop play, can be put together to form
                    the temple of the \Monster{drow}, while the reverse sides feature other
                    fantastic dungeon locations players can explore.".

  description       "In ages past, those who wielded psionic power were ignored. Then, as folk
                    witnessed firsthand their strange abilities, they were scorned and treated
                    like outcasts. Over time, they have carved niches for themselves in
                    society. Now you can rub shoulders with them at the local inn, trade with
                    them in the bustling streets, and follow them on some great
                    adventure. Psionic characters are everywhere, and your world is all the
                    better for it.
                    This companion to \Product{Expanded Psionics Handbook} builds on the existing
                    psionics rules and presents exciting new options for psionic characters and
                    psionic 'dabblers'. In addition to clarifying concepts introduced
                    in\Product{Expanded Psionics Handbook}, it presents three new standard
                    classes---the \Class{ardent}, the \Class{erudite}, and the
                    \Class{lurk}---plus a host of new prestige classes, feats, spells, magic
                    items, astral constructs, and organizations.
                    The essential sourcebook for expanding the use of psionic power by any
                    character.
                    \Product{Complete Psionic} provides new options for creating and playing rich
                    psionic characters. Whether you're playing a devoted \Class{psion} or
                    \Class{psionic warrior}, or a member of a psionic race, or are just looking
                    to expand your character's options, this sourcebook has something for
                    you. Players and Dungeon Masters gain access to new combat options, powers,
                    equipment, and prestige classes, as well as exciting new character
                    classes. \Product{Complete Psionic} also provides new information on psionic
                    organizations, and Dungeon Masters will find material for incorporating
                    psionics into their campaign worlds.";

  description       "In ages past, \Monster{dragons} ruled supreme. Now their distant scions, the
                    race and individuals who carry their blood, live among the great empires of
                    the world, where they forge their own glorious legacies. You can be among
                    them. Embrace your draconic heritage, and the spoils of the world can be
                    yours!
                    This supplement for the D&D game provides detailed information on the
                    psychology, society, culture, behavior, religion, and folklore of the
                    dragonblooded races, including \Monster{kobolds} and
                    \Monster{half-dragons}. This book introduces two new player character races:
                    the \Monster{dragonborn} (existing characters reborn in a new draconic form
                    to combat and destroy the spawn of \God{Tiamat}) and the
                    \Monster{spellscales} (artistic, philosophical beings with a penchant for
                    sorcery and a thirst for new experiences). It also provides new prestige
                    classes, feats, spells, magic items, equipment, and guidelines for crafting
                    adventures and campaigns involving dragonblooded races.
                    A new D&D sourcebook detailing races descended from \Monster{dragons}.
                    \Product{Races of the Dragon} provides D&D players and Dungeon Masters with
                    an in-depth look at races descended from or related to \Monster{dragons}. In
                    addition to exploring the fan-favorite \Monster{kobold} race, \Product{Races
                    of the Dragon} introduces two new races, \Monster{dragonborn} and
                    \Monster{spellscales}, and provides information on
                    \Monster{half-dragons}. The \Monster{dragonborn} are a transitive race, an
                    exciting new concept that allows players to transform from their initial race
                    into a new one. This book also includes a wealth of cultural information and
                    new prestige classes, feats, equipment, spells, and magic items.

  description       "Out of the maelstrom of chaos the \Monster{demons} came---a primordial horde
                    of perverse souls consumed by hatred. They are as ancient and infinite as the
                    multiverse itself. Even the bottomless \Place{Abyss} could not contain their
                    malice, and so they spread out across the planes, corrupting and destroying
                    everything in their path. No living soul is beyond their reach, and with each
                    conquered soul their numbers grow. What can stand against such a terrifying
                    onslaught?
                    This supplement for the D&D game presents the definitive treatise on
                    \Monster{demons} ant their unspeakable home plane. Along with information
                    about the physiology, psychology, society, and schemes of demonkind, you'll
                    find feats, spells, items, and tactics commonly employed by \Monster{demons}
                    and those who oppose them. This book also provides detailed information on
                    various \Monster{demons}, \Monster{demon lords}, and \Place{Abyssal layers}.
                    \Product{Fiendish Codex I: Hordes of the Abyss} is a comprehensive sourcebook
                    covering the most dangerous (and popular) \Monster{fiends} in the Dungeons &

                    the powers, tactics, and organization of the forces of the \Place{Abyss} --
                    both those covered in the \Product{Monster Manual} and entirely new foes. In
                    addition, this book provides new rules, feats, tactics, spells, and equipment
                    for characters who battle fiends. Extensive story and campaign elements add
                    dimension to playing or fighting creatures of this type. Included is
                    extensive information on the layers of the \Place{Abyss} and the ruling demon
                    lords, demonic possession, and how to use demons in a campaign.";

  description       "Every sentient creature is born with some potential to work magic. However,
                    true mastery of arcane magic requires skill, practice, and power beyond the
                    reach of common folk---specifically, the power to harness raw magic and shape
                    it into a desired effect. You are among those gifted few who have learned to
                    channel arcane magic, shaping it to serve your creative or destructive whims.
                    This D&D supplement is intended for players and Dungeon Masters. In addition
                    to providing the definitive treatise on arcane magic, it expands the
                    character options available to users of arcane magic, including bards,
                    sorcerers, wizards, assassins, warlocks, and wu jen. Herein you'll find
                    never-before-seen prestige classes, spells and invocations, magic items,
                    alchemical items, heritage feats, and reserve feats (a new type of feat that
                    grants special abilities to those who remain charged with magical
                    power). Alternative class features give other character classes---from the
                    barbarian to the rogue-—-a little taste of what it's like to be an arcanist
                    without sacrificing their core identities.";

  description       "The \Place{Wyrmsmoke Mountains} shook with the thunder of ten thousand
                    screaming \Monster{hobgoblin} soldiers. From the phalanx emerged a single
                    champion. One by one the tribes fell silent as the warlord rose up, blue
                    scales gleaming along his shoulders, horns swept back from his head. A
                    hundred bright yellow banners stood beneath him, each marked with a great
                    read hand. He stood upon a precipice and raised his arms. 'I am \NPC{Azarr
                    Kul}, \NPC{Son of the Dragon}!' the warlord bellowed. 'Hear me! Tomorrow we
                    march to war!'
                    \Product{Red Hand of Doom} is a Dungeons & Dragons adventure designed to take
                    characters from the 6th level to the 12th level. Confronted with the
                    relentless advance of \NPC{Azurr Kul's horde}, the characters must undertake
                    vital missions to influence the outcome of the war. Can they shatter the
                    armies of the enemy, or will \NPC{Azarr Kul}'s dreams rain destruction upon
                    the human lands?
                    An exciting super-adventure that pits heroes against an army bent on
                    domination.
                    Rampaging \Monster{hobgoblins} and their allies threaten to destroy the realm
                    and all who stand before them. Characters who dare confront the horde soon
                    discover that these particular \Monster{hobgoblins} worship \God{Tiamat}, the
                    evil queen of \Monster{dragons}, and eventually come face-to-face with her
                    \Monster{draconic} minions.
                    This 128-page adventure features a new format easily used by Dungeon
                    Masters. The \Product{Red Hand of Doom} includes encounters designed for use
                    with the D&D miniatures game.";

                    the party's next visit to the city a vibrant and exhilarating event.";

                    eyes burn with eternal hunger and contempt for life. From a narrow balcony,
                    he peers out into the drizzling twilight at the few sad lights of the village
                    below and mutters a single name:
                    'Ireena...'}

                    the original 1st Edition \Place{Ravenloft} module, retaining the Gothic
                    flavor and familiar elements while expanding and reimagining some of the
                    locations to create a deeper, richer adventure experience.

  description       "Since the dawn of the DUNGEONS & DRAGONS game, the dungeon has remained a

                    through the earth, eager for their next meal. Savage \Monster{orcs} lurk
                    within the darkness, ready to surge forth and lay waste to civilized
                    lands. Strange cults, mutated monsters, and forgotten gods hide within the
                    choking darkness of the dungeon's halls. Nowhere else offers greater
                    prospects for wealth, magic, and power. Yet the horrors that lurk beneath the
                    world never give up their treasures without a fight....
                    This D&D supplement presents a refreshing new take on dungeon adventures. It
                    shows Dungeon Masters how to inject excitement, innovation, and thrilling
                    adventure into their dungeons. New rules for encounter traps allow DMs to
                    build deadly snares to catch the unwary. For players, the factotum class is a
                    cunning wanderer, a jack-of-all-trades who can cope with anything the dungeon
                    throws at him. New equipment, feats, and prestige classes give adventurers
                    the tools they need to survive the dark beneath the earth.";

  description       "Centuries ago, forces of good and evil collided in a titanic battle at the
                    mountain fortress of \Place{Slaughtergarde}. Armies of mortals and
                    \Monster{angels} fought and defeated a rampaging \Monster{demon} horde,
                    banished its demon prince, and tore \Place{Slaughtergarde} apart, hurling it
                    back into the \Place{Abyss}. However, the destruction of
                    \Place{Slaughtergarde} was incomplete. Parts of the fortress were embedded
                    underneath the \Place{Valley of Obelisks}, buried for all time. Now, malign
                    forces have found \Place{Slaughtergarde}'s dark chambers, and they toil
                    ceaselessly to restore the magic gates that will reconnect
                    \Place{Slaughtergarde} to the \Place{Abyss}. If they aren't stopped, a new
                    \Monster{demon} horde may emerge from the shattered fortress to rampage
                    across the world.
                    This adventure takes characters from 1st level to 6th level, and it includes
                    material that can be used to expand the story to an entire campaign. Inside
                    the folder are a 64-page \emph{Adventure Site} book, a 64-page \emph{Campaign
                    Guide}. a 16-page \emph{Player's Guide}, 9 pages of illustrations to enhance

                    16-page booklet that presents sample encounters designed for use with the
                    maps.
                    The battle maps feature fantastic terrain designed to create large, fluid
                    encounters, key scenes, and exciting game sessions. Rather than simple
                    dungeon encounters, these maps evoke the epic struggles that campaign
                    memories are made of. Three of the maps also make ideal battlegrounds for
                    \Product{D&D Miniatures Game} play. Build your own warband and fight for
                    control of \Place{Hailstorm Tower}, the \Place{Caves of Chaos}, or the

                    in the mausoleum, and brave adventurers are needed to explore the catacombs
                    beneath the graves and discover what evil stirs in the darkling depths.
                    \Product{Barrow of the Forgotten King} is a D&D adventure designed for
                    2nd-level characters. It can be played as a stand-alone adventure or as the
                    first adventure in a three-part series. Each encounter contains special
                    tactical information for the Dungeon Master and expanded map features for
                    ease of play.
                    The mighty statue of a forgotten king stands atop a lonely hill overlooking
                    the town of \Place{Kingsholm}. No one remembers the ancient sovereign or his
                    dynasty, but locals shun the graveyard on the hillside near the
                    statue. Sinister shapes lurk among the tombstones, and evil stirs in the
                    catacombs below.";

Throaty growls indicated a dispute among \NPC{Yeenoghu}'s pack. \NPC{Obox-ob}'s insect swarms chittered while \NPC{Demogorgon} ranted from the central podium. The other emissaries seemed restless. Across the hall, \NPC{Graz'zt} met \God{Lolth}'s gaze and smile. The \Monster{demon queen} shivered with a tingle of foreboding.}
                    This Dungeons & Dragons adventure takes characters from the planar city of \Place{Sigil} to the darkest corners of the \Place{Outer Planes}, gathering resources to battle the forces of \God{Lolth}, Demon Queen of \Monster{Spiders}. The player characters must navigate a carefully spun web of treachery and deceit to reach the violent heart of \God{Lolth}'s domain and put and end to her sinister dreams of conquest.
                    This campaign adventure is designed for characters of levels 9-12 and features an easy-to-use combat encounter format and player handouts. This book also presents new prestige classes and magic items for player characters.".

In addition to new feats, spells, items, and prestige classes, the \Product{Complete Champion} game supplement presents exciting adventure locations, affiliation mechanics for different deities and organizations, and a system for designing your own religions based on the cleric domain system. Alternative class features for every standard class and more reserve feasts provide extended options for players interested in creating or advancing characters along a road to divine power.".

  description       "\emph{Twenty-seven years ago, a band of adventurers led by the great wizard \NPC{Mordenkainen} entered the dungeons below \Place{Castle Greyhawk} and released the evil demigod \God{Iuz}, intending to slay him. Betrayal led to failure, \God{Iuz} escaped, and many lives were lost. Today, evil has returned to \Place{Castle Greyhawk}, and \NPC{Mordenkainen} must place his trust in the hands of a new generation of heroes. Those who fail will be lost, and those who triumph will be legends.}
                    \Place{Castle Greyhawk} has become a grand fixture of the \Place{Cairn Hills}, tempting the likes of \NPC{Mordenkainen}, \NPC{Bigby}, and \NPC{Tenser} with its dark mysteries. Today it lies in ruin, ravaged by the years and countless assaults. However, many of its greatest treasures and secrets remain hidden in the sprawling dungeons beneath, where terrible monsters and fiendish traps defy new generations of heroes in search of fame and glory.
                    This campaign adventure revists the legendary ruins of \Place{Castle Greyhawk} and its dungeons, incorporating many new twists and suprises. It is designed for characters of levels 8-13 and features an easy-to-use combat encounter format. This book also presents several new monsters and magical items.".

  description       "For generations, the \Place{Tomb of Horrors} has held an inescapable allure. It draws adventurers to it like a beacon and the devours them utterly like some monstrous predator. Within its sepulchral, trap-ridden halls and chambers lay the secrets and treasures of the \Monster{demilich} \NPC{Acererak} and, some say, the \Monster{demilich} himself.
                    \Product{Tomb of Horros} is a far-reaching Dungeons & Dragons adventure that takes characters from 10th level to 22nd level, with natural break periods between stages for other adventures. It includes background material, adventure hooks, new monsters and magic items, and a powerful campaign arc that pits heroes against a deadly dungeon complex and its echoes in the planes of the \Place{Feywild} and the \Place{Shadowfell}. This adventure also includes a double-sided map depicting key encounter sites.";

{The runeblade, a base class that combines magic and martial skill without the need for spells}
{Additional skills, feats, and combat rules}
{Dozens of spells and magic items}

Inherent within these two books is the idea that characters should be able to keep on adventuring longer than the rules currently allow and that every class can use some extra options for greater playability.

\bold{Game Masters}, reward your players with cold hard coin after an epic battle or the plundering of a long lost tomb!

\bold{Players}, equip yourself with a belt pouch and guard your precious gold!";

  "Unser Gehirn ist ein Organ, das wie jedes andere Organ auch gepflegt und
  trainiert werden will, damit es einwandfrei arbeitet. Gutes
  Ged\umlaut{a}chtnis ist kein Zufall. Kreativi\umlaut{a}t auch
  nicht. Erfolgreicher Umgang mit anderen Menschen schon gar nicht.

  Sie finden hier abwechselnd Denksportaufgaben und Knobeleien, an denen Sie
  sich die geistigen Z\umlaut{a}hne ausbeissen k\umlaut{o}nnen, und Tests und
  Anregungen zu ganz anderen Gehirnleistungen, die Sie auch nicht in dern
  Schule lernen konnten. Testen Sie Ihr Ged\umlaut{a}chtnis, Ihren Umgang mit
  Zahlen, mit anderen Menschen, mit schwierigen Entscheidungen. Und lassen Sie
  sich auf das Abenteuer ein, wie Sie Ihre Kreativi\umlaut{a}t, Ihre
  Entscheidungssicherheit und Ihre Kommunikationsstrukturen auf Vordermann
  bringen k\umlaut{o}nnen. Erfolg ist kein Zufall, Erfolg kann man lernen.

  Niemand ist zu alt, sein Gehirn zu trainieren. Frangen Sie gleich damit an,
  Sie halten den wohl spannendsten und zugleich verst\umlaut{a}ndlichsten
  Expander in der Hand, den sich Ihr Gehirn nur w\umlaut{u}nschen kann.";
