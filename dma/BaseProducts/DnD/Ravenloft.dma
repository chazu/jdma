                    country road. Footsteps echo behind him, in pace with his beating heart. Is
                    it Death who follows? The man turns, and so turns the phantom. A flash of
                    fang, a bloodcurdling howl, red eyes fueled by a passion from beyond the
                    grave. The traveler discovers what others have learned before him: all roads
                    lead to \Place{Ravenloft}.}
                    \Place{Ravenloft} is a new realm of terror for AD&D adventures, rooted in the
                    Gothic tradition. It is a \Place{demiplane of dread and desire}, a world
                    whose misty fingers can reach into any other campaign setting and draw
                    unsuspecting heroes into its midst. Once it holds them in its icy embrace, it
                    may never let them go...

  description       "\large{Time Is Meaningless in \Place{Castle Tristenoira}}
                    \emph{\Place{Forlorn} has long remained hidden in the shadows of notorious
                    \Place{Barovia} and \Place{Kartakass}, yet the tiniest domain in the
                    \Place{lands of the core} is nearly as old as \Place{Ravenloft} itself. This
                    land is sick with evil, a twisted mockery of the place it once was. It is
                    filled with creatures of despair who were drawn into the \Place{demiplane of
                    dread}...
                    Within \Place{Castle Tristenoira} lies oblivion. The crumbling keep slips in
                    and out of time, carrying its unwary explorers across the centuries, where
                    they may bye abandoned to the cold winds of eternity---and to the ghosts in
                    the castle! Spirits both innocent and guilty haunt the timeless passages,
                    whispering tales of murder and vengeance. Escape is for the lucky...or the
                    hopelessly mad.}
                    The \Product{Castles Forlorn} boxed adventure set provides the Dungeon Master
                    with a rich and complex domain in which to set a campaign of any size and
                    duration. It includes a 96-page sourcebook, \emph{The Weeping Land}, which
                    reveals the complete history of the domain and the strange terrible lord who
                    rules over it. Descriptions of the living and dead who call this lonely land
                    home abound, as do details of the forbidding \Place{Tristonia castle}, where
                    adventurers may spend an evening or an age.
                    After learning \Place{Forlorn}'s history of sorrow, the DM can lead player
                    characters into \emph{Melancholy Meetings}, a 32-page collection of
                    encounters that provide adventure in every corner of the domain. Finally,
                    only \emph{Eve of Sorrows} remains, which is a 32-page assortment of
                    mysteries and nightmares within the castle itself.
                    This deluxe boxed adventure set complete the portrait of \Place{Forlorn} with
                    a highly detailed, double-sided poster map of the castle, a poster map of the
                    domain, and a special wall poster created by award-winning artist Robh
                    Ruppel---all in full color.".

  description       "\large{Terror in the \Place{Land of Mists}}
                    In the year 351 of the \Place{Barovian} calendar, \NPC{Strahd von Zarovich}
                    made a pact with \God{Death}---a pact that sealed his fate and created a land
                    of nightmares known as \Place{Ravenloft}. Other lords of darkness have
                    embraced the \Place{Demiplane of Dread} as their own, and woe to heroes who
                    wander there. Creatures of the night prey freely upon the living in this
                    land, and day is but a prelude to another night of horror.
                    This new edition of the \Product{Ravenloft} game combines the original
                    \Product{Realm of Terror} boxed set with elements from \Product{Forbidden
                    Lore} and updated rules from other accessories. Domains destroyed in the
                    famous \Event{Grand Conjunction} have been deleted, new domains added, and
                    key personalities detailed. This boxed set includes:

                    Dread}. In the unique domain called the \Place{Nightmare Lands}, darkness
                    offers not blissful slumber, but ultimate terror. Heroes enter this realm at
                    the bidding of the night, drawn from their dreaming bodies and captured by an
                    enigmatic figure known only as the \NPC{Nightmare Man}. Trapped in this
                    region of psychological fear, heroes face their worst nightmares in strange,
                    surrealistic terrain. If they escape the treacherous clutches of dark

  description       "Under raging stormclouds, a lone figure stands silhouetted against the
                    ancient walls of castle \Place{Ravenloft}. Count \NPC{Strah von Zarovich}
                    stares down a sheer cliff at the village below. A cold, bitter wind spins
                    dead leaves about him, billowing his cape in the darkness.
                    Lightning splits the clouds overhead, casting stark white light across
                    him. \NPC{Strahd} turns to the sky, revealing the angular muscles of his face
                    and hands. He has a look of power---and of madness. His once-handsome face is
                    contorted by a tragedy darken than the night itself.
                    Rumbling thunder pounds the castle spires. The wind's howling increases as
                    \NPC{Strahd} turns his gaze back to the village. Far below, yet not beyond
                    his keen eyesight, a party of adventurers has just entered his
                    domain. \NPC{Strahd}'s face forms a twisted smile as his dark plan
                    unfolds. He knew they were coming, and he knows why they came, all according
                    to his plan. He, the master of \Place{Ravenloft}, will attend to them.
                    Another lightning flash rips through the darkness, its thunder echoing
                    through the castle's towers. But \NPC{Strahd} is gone. Only the howling of
                    the wind---or perhaps a lone wolf---fills the midnight air. The master of
                    \Place{Ravenloft} is having guests for dinner. And you are invited.";

                    stalked, confronted, and destroyed.

                    vampiric \Monster{mind flayers} in his laboratories! His prodigies are
                    horribly insane, but if he can complete his plans, he will achieve a new

                    success, but they have paid a heavy price for the bravery and are in

  description       "There is a black terror that amasses great authority in the farthest reaches
                    of \Place{Ravenloft}, quietly insinuating its sway upon the land like a
                    creeping poison in the body: Its name is \Monster{lich}.
                    Until now, \Monster{vampires} have been the undisputed masters of darkness,
                    but the sheer genius of the \Monster{lich} (coupled with its immortal quest
                    for ever more powerful magic) has proven to be a malevolent threat to the
                    cause of Goodness. \Monster{Liches} were once all-powerful wizards in life,
                    yet they have sacrificed everything to leap beyond the bounds of humanity and
                    acquire unspeakable necromantic mastery.
                    In the face of such might and malice, there appears to be one hope:
                    \NPC{Dr. Rudolph Van Richten}, scholar and bane to all creatures of the
                    night, has once again picked up quill and parchment---this time to expose
                    this dreaded monster's darkest secrets! Within these pages the reader will
                    learn of the \Monster{lich}'s origins, its powers, its lair, and even its
                    very psychological makeup as well as the keys to a successful hunt and
                    termination. Deadly new minions and unique \Monster{lich} magicks are also
                    brought to the fore.
                    Take back the night, all ye of courageous heart and keen blade! With each
                    chime of the clock, the \Monster{lich} seeks to complete another of its
                    diabolical schemes. Unchecked, the monster will obliterate the light of day,
                    and \Place{Ravenloft} is already much too dark...";

                    their rest. When the ancient dead rise and walk again, evil spreads before
                    them and destruction lies in their wake.
                    In the land of mists, the ancient dead are unique monstrosities of
                    astonishing power, capable of rising again and again despite the efforts of
                    the mightiest heroes. Only \NPC{Rudolph van Richten}, \Place{Ravenloft}'s
                    greatest foe of darkness, has accrued the knowledge necessary to stop
                    them. Within this treatise the doctor classifies these complex creatures,
                    defines their common characteristics, and speculates upon their salient
                    abilities. It may be impossible to destroy the ancient dead, but with
                    persistence, good fortune, and \NPC{Van Richten}'s wise counsel, one might
                    send them back to their dreams...".

                    warping the very Land around them to suit their needs.

                    presented in this book is a unique individual with its own history,
                    personality, and powers.

                    \Product{Children of the Night: Vampires} is the first book in a new series

                    \Product{Castle Spulzeer}. The unique nature of this domain and scenario

                    without forcing players through a linear plot. Alternate endings allow the DM
