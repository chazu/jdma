                    AD&D game action is fast-paced. Keeping track of who's where in the dungeon
                    can be hard, especially during combat. That's why players and DM's agree that
                    official AD&D miniatures make a great game even greater.
                    And yes, a \Monster{troll} \emph{is} that much bigger than your
                    character. All 25mm AD&D miniatures are in scale to one another, for added
                    realism.".

Durable interlocking wall segments quickly snap together to form 'chains' of dungeon walls. Simple place a length of walls onto the game mat, and 'bend' it into the shape of your dungeon room. Snap it apart to add freestanding doors, and just like that, you're done! It's easy, convenient, adds a cool factor of 3D to your game, and most important... it's fast!
                    Build just the dungeon areas you need... as you need them. During play! No need for the gamemaster to spend hours of extra prep time setting up the dungeon, and the players don't get the peek ahead. It's easy to recycle, too... just pick up the pieces of the rooms your party are done with, and use them to build the next room! \bold{The adventure never ends with \Product{Bendy Dungeon Walls}... It's a Dungeon Life!}

                    Made from durable acrylic, Combat Tiers are designed to easily engage your gaming experience. The transparent material will not obscure the gaming environment. Multi-tier possibilities allow you to create various heights, while the large staging platforms allow the players to place multiple figures in simulated flight or combat, keeping everything sturdy and precise. Combat Tiers are gauged in one inch increments both on the prominent staging platforms and on the supporting columns, so ranges can be easily determined at a glance. With additional extensions, your figures can soar to even higher heights. No longer are ranges reduced to estimations—know exactly how the battle unfolds!
                    Combat Tiers can simulate many environments—use them to gauge underwater and space environments in addition to flight. For military enthusiasts, planes come alive during raids and strafing runs, and ships and submarines enjoy a new level of silent running as altitudes and depths take on a whole new gaming dimension.
                    Combat Tiers truly invigorate all your combat gaming situations.";

                    battle tactics, and other game elements. This rulebook also features the two

                    purchaser the same learning experience right out of the box. Two full-color,
                    double-sided maps supply vital play surfaces and also make a great visual
                    impact.
                    In addition to new components, the overall game rules have been updated to
                    facilitate faster gameplay and encourage larger battles. Rules have been
                    adjusted to accommodate any size figure, from tiny to huge and even beyond,
                    and will be compatible with any D&D Miniatures Game release. Per previous
                    releases, the figures in the set are selected from key D&D roleplaying games
                    titles such as Monster Manual, Monster Manual III, Miniatures Handbook, and
                    the Eberron and Forgotten Realms campaign settings. The set also includes an
