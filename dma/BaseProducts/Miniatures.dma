  "\large{'A \Monster{troll} is that much bigger than my magic-user?'}

  Your magic-user could throw a \Spell{fireball} at the beast, but where's the
  rest of your party---the fighter, the cleric and the \Monster{dwarf}? Would
  the flames engulf them, too?

  AD&D game action is fast-paced. Keeping track of who's where in the dungeon
  can be hard, especially during combat. That's why players and DM's agree that
  official AD&D miniatures make a great game even greater.

  And yes, a \Monster{troll} \emph{is} that much bigger than your
  character. All 25mm AD&D miniatures are in scale to one another, for added
  realism.".

  "\emph{Your mini's deserve someplace cool to play!}

\produyct{Dungeon Life: Bendy Dungeon Walls} offers an excellent solution to the age-old problem of the 3D dungeon. Durable interlocking wall segments quickly snap together to form 'chains' of dungeon walls. Simple place a length of walls onto the game mat, and 'bend' it into the shape of your dungeon room. Snap it apart to add freestanding doors, and just like that, you're done! It's easy, convenient, adds a cool factor of 3D to your game, and most important... it's fast!

Build just the dungeon areas you need... as you need them. During play! No need for the gamemaster to spend hours of extra prep time setting up the dungeon, and the players don't get the peek ahead. It's easy to recycle, too... just pick up the pieces of the rooms your party are done with, and use them to build the next room! \bold{The adventure never ends with \Product{Bendy Dungeon Walls}... It's a Dungeon Life!}

  "Combat Tiers bring a new dimension to tabletop gaming scenarios where height and distance are needed. Eliminating guesswork, Combat Tiers place any size miniatures at the exact height and distance needed to determine where combatants are during your battle scenarios.

Made from durable acrylic, Combat Tiers are designed to easily engage your gaming experience. The transparent material will not obscure the gaming environment. Multi-tier possibilities allow you to create various heights, while the large staging platforms allow the players to place multiple figures in simulated flight or combat, keeping everything sturdy and precise. Combat Tiers are gauged in one inch increments both on the prominent staging platforms and on the supporting columns, so ranges can be easily determined at a glance. With additional extensions, your figures can soar to even higher heights. No longer are ranges reduced to estimations—know exactly how the battle unfolds!

Combat Tiers can simulate many environments—use them to gauge underwater and space environments in addition to flight. For military enthusiasts, planes come alive during raids and strafing runs, and ships and submarines enjoy a new level of silent running as altitudes and depths take on a whole new gaming dimension.

Combat Tiers truly invigorate all your combat gaming situations.";
