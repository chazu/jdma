                    In a corner of the world far removed from the known \Place{Forgotten Realms}
                    stands the exotic continent of \Place{Maztica}. There \NPC{Erix} the slave
                    girl learns of a great destiny laid upon her by the gods themselves. At the
                    same time, across the sea, a fateful mission of exploration embarks.
                    The explorers, a legion of seasoned mercenaries, sail westward to discover a
                    land of primitive savagery mixed with high culture, of brutal, bloodthirsty
                    gods and lavish treasures. Under the banner of their vigilant god,
                    \God{Helm}, the legion claims these lands for their own.
                    Only as \NPC{Erix} sees her land invaded by these strangers, when her world
                    itself starts to collapse around her, is her starling destiny revealed...
                    \Product{Ironhelm} is the first novel in \Product{The Maztica Trilogy},
                    Douglas Niles's newest epic saga based on the \Product{Forgotten Realms}
                    fantasy setting.".

                    the artifact is hidden somewhere in the danger-filled jungles and recovering
                    it are two entirely different matters, however---especially when a lost city,

                    rewriting the past in their memories and adding dangerous new tales to their

                    \Monster{green dragon} who holds the key to the mystery. To do so,

                    \NPC{Danilo} is drawn into a web of riddles and magic. Bardcraft is more
                    demanding than \NPC{Danilo} imagined, and he must find within himself the
                    strength to wield a new and unexpected power.".

                    \Product{Elfshadow}, because of her lyrical writing style and characters
                    possessed of more than two dimenions.'

                    The child's mother will be leaving this house', \NPC{Gromph Baenre} told the
                    \Monster{elf}-size \Monster{golem}. 'See to it, and inform her family that
                    she met with an unfortunate accident on the way to the \Place{Bazaar}.
                    The stone servant bowed and then disappeared into the wall as easily as a
                    \Monster{wraith} might pass through a fog bank. A moment later, the scream of
                    a \Monster{drow} female came from a nearby chamber---a scream that began in
                    terror and ended in a liquid gurgle.
                    \NPC{Gromph} leaned forward and blew out the candle, for darkness best
                    revealed the character of the \Monster{drow}. All light fled the room, and
                    the archmage's eyes changed from amber to brilliant red as his vision slipped
                    into the head-reading spectrum.
                    'Your are \NPC{Liriel Baenre}, my daughter and a noble of the First House of
                    \Place{Menzoberranzan}', he announced, and then sat back to study the child's
                    reaction.
                    The crimson glow of head and warmth drained from her face, and her tiny,
                    pale-knuckled hands gripped the edge of the desk for support. It was clear
                    that the little \Monster{drow} understood all that had just occurred. Her
                    expression remained stoic, however, and her voice was firm when she repeated
                    her new name.
                    \NPC{Gromph} nodded approvingly. \NPC{Liriel} had accepted the reality of the
                    situation---she could hardly do otherwise and survive---yet the rage and
                    frustration of an untamed spirit burned bright in her eyes.
                    This was his daughter, indeed.".

  description       "\emph{'I have been a fan of Elaine Cunningham's since I read
                    \Product{Elfshadow}, because of her lyrical writing style and characters
                    possessed of more than two dimenions.'
                    \right{R.A. Salvatore}}
                    The child's mother will be leaving this house', \NPC{Gromph Baenre} told the
                    \Monster{elf}-size \Monster{golem}. 'See to it, and inform her family that
                    she met with an unfortunate accident on the way to the \Place{Bazaar}.
                    The stone servant bowed and then disappeared into the wall as easily as a
                    \Monster{wraith} might pass through a fog bank. A moment later, the scream of
                    a \Monster{drow} female came from a nearby chamber---a scream that began in
                    terror and ended in a liquid gurgle.
                    \NPC{Gromph} leaned forward and blew out the candle, for darkness best
                    revealed the character of the \Monster{drow}. All light fled the room, and
                    the archmage's eyes changed from amber to brilliant red as his vision slipped
                    into the head-reading spectrum.
                    'Your are \NPC{Liriel Baenre}, my daughter and a noble of the First House of
                    \Place{Menzoberranzan}', he announced, and then sat back to study the child's
                    reaction.
                    The crimson glow of head and warmth drained from her face, and her tiny,
                    pale-knuckled hands gripped the edge of the desk for support. It was clear
                    that the little \Monster{drow} understood all that had just occurred. Her
                    expression remained stoic, however, and her voice was firm when she repeated
                    her new name.
                    \NPC{Gromph} nodded approvingly. \NPC{Liriel} had accepted the reality of the
                    situation---she could hardly do otherwise and survive---yet the rage and
                    frustration of an untamed spirit burned bright in her eyes.
                    This was his daughter, indeed.".

                    \NPC{Candlemas} bets fellow wizard \NPC{Sysquemalyn} that a certain

                    his friend---and deadly rival---can devise. The only rule: The tests must
                    offer the subject some chance to survive, however slight.
                    Of course, 'playing fair' is a concept as alien to \Class{wizards} of
                    \Place{Netheril} as 'mercy'.
                    But the subject of their wager, \NPC{Sunbright Steelshanks} of the
                    \Group{Rengarth Tribe}, has a mind---and a will---of his own. And

                    statuesque and skillful daughter, but he does mind that she has the

  description       "The forces aligned against \Place{Menzoberranzan} begin to take shape, and
                    the threat to \Monster{drow} civilization is more terrifying than anyone has
                    yet imagined. From the impenetrable shadows of the \Place{Underdark} to the
                    remote corners of the no less unforgiving \Place{World Above}, the path
                    toward the secrets of \God{Lolth}'s silence is as unpredictable as it is
                    deadly.
                    Joined by two \Monster{drow} who might be the last survivors of \Place{Ched
                    Nasad}, the explorers from \Place{Menzoberranzan} have learned much, but for
                    every answer they find, a thousand new questions arise. They must seek out a
                    rival priest, in hopes that he can speed them on their way to the goddess
                    herself, but can one dark elf ever trust another?
                    The third novel in an epic six-part series from the fertile imaginations of
                    R.A. Salvatore, and a select group of the newest, most exciting authors in
                    the genre. Join them as they shine a light into the blackest recesses of the
                    \Place{Forgotten Realms} world, only to deepen the shadows within.".

                    can believe, let alone match. He has devoted his entire life---a life spent
                    in the twisted body of a \Monster{half-golem}---to killing every
                    \Monster{dragon} he can find.
                    You might feel the same way if one of them had killed your entire family in
                    front of your eyes, bitten you in half, and left you for dead.
                    Killing one \Monster{dragon} at a time is hard enough, but when the
                    irresistible impulse to slip into feral madness begins to overcome not one,
                    but every \Monster{dragon} all across \Place{Faer\hat{u}n}, civilization's
                    only hope may line in the last alliance \NPC{Dorn} and his fellow
                    \Monster{dragon} hunters would ever accept.
                    No matter what happens, the next year is going to be a difficult one for
                    \Monster{Dorn}, and for \Place{Faer\hat{u}n} itself.
                    The Year of Rogue Dragons has come.".

                    \bold{The \Event{War of the Spider Queen} comes to an end.}
                    The final novel in an epic six-part series from the fertile imaginations of
                    R.A. Salvatore and a select group of the newest, most exciting authors in the
                    genre. Join them as they bring an end to a devastating war, and give birth to
                    the greatest horror the Realms has ever known.
                    But something is different, something her priestesses can hear in the winds,
                    feel in their spirits, and for a select few see with their own eyes. The
                    \Place{Demonweb Pits}, removed from the \Place{Abyss} to take its place among
                    the lower planes, is more dangerous, more horrifying than anyone has ever
                    imagined. Teeming with feral \Monster{spiders} bent on ripping each other to
                    pieces -- killing, eating, and killing again -- the blasted landscape of
                    \God{Lolth}'s personal hell is still forming.
                    \NPC{Quenthel Baenre}, with the tattered remnants of her expedition
                    continuing to plot against her, crosses that \Monster{spider}-infested
                    killing ground in hopes of answering the call of her reborn goddess. If she
                    can make it to \God{Lolth}'s side, can she even imagine what plans the
                    \God{Queen of the Demonweb Pits} has had for her all along?";

                    revealed. But knowing the cause of a disease and curing it are two very
                    different things.
                    And when most of the victims of the curse would rather not be cured of it at
                    all, it gets a whole lot harder.
                    Far up in the frozen wastelands of the bitter north, a ruined citadel holds
                    the key to the Rage, and \Monster{dragons} alive and undead, sane and mad,
                    good and evil, converge there to decide the fate of their mighty race. For a
                    \Monster{half-golem} dragonslayer ending the curse has become less a mission
                    of duty than of love, and that only makes it more vital that he succeed.
                    It's been a difficult year for \NPC{Dorn} and the allies but before it's over
                    more blood will be spilled. The Year of Rogue Dragons draws to a close.

                    \NPC{Drizzt} has fought alone, but as the conflict draws to a bloody
                    conclusion, the \NPC{Hunter} will have to find allies both new and old---or
                    die along with the rest of the civilized \Place{North}.
                    The conclusion of the \emph{New York Time} best-selling trilogy decides the
                    fate of \NPC{Drizzt Do'Urden}.
                    This title is the third and final book in the latest trilogy from
                    R.A. Salvatore, which once again features his popular \Monster{dark elf}
                    character \NPC{Drizzt Do'Urden}. The hardcover release of this title had the
                    highest debut ever on The New York Times best seller list for a Salvatore
                    title with Wizards of the Coast at #4. The title stayed in the top twenty for
                    five weeks. Both of the previous titles in the series were also New York
                    Times best sellers upon hardcover release, and the first title, \Product{The
                    Thousand Orcs}, hit the list upon mass-market release as well.".
