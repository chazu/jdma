  "...Some of the parchment pages were the color of cream, thick and
  substantial, made to last many, many lifetimes. Other pages were thin and
  desiccated, positively yellow from age, and crackled alarmingly as \NPC{Van
  Richten} turned them over. There were no ornate illuminations, no fussy
  borders, only lines of plain text in hard black ink. The flowing handwriting
  was a bit difficult to follow at first; the writer's style of calligraphy had
  not been in common use for three hundred years. No table of contents, but
  from the dates it looked to be some kind of history.

  He turned to the first page and read:

  \emph{I, \NPC{Strahd}, \NPC{Lord of \Place{Barovia}}, well aware certain
  events of my reign have been desperately misunderstood by those who are
  better at garbling history than recording it, hereby set down an exact record
  of those events, that the truth may at last be known....}

  description
  "In the bell tower of \Place{Nartok Keep} there lives a monster. At least, so
  it is whispered in the village below. But \NPC{Wort} is no monster. He is
  merely a man---gentle and lonely, his form hideously twisted by fate.

  When a good deed earns \NPC{Wort} only the revilement of \Place{Nartok}'s
  folk, he makes a dark decision. If they think him a monster, then that is
  exactly what he will be...

  \Product{Tower of Doom} is the ninth in an open-ended series of Gothic horror
  tales dealing with the masters and monsters of the \Product{Ravenloft} dark
  fantasy setting.".

  discover the source of the curse that blackens his spirit.

  to serve. But how has her burden become his?
