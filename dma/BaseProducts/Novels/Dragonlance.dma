One man, the powerful archmage \NPC{Raistlin}, intends that the darkness return.

Two people alone can stop him. One is \NPC{Crysania}, a beautiful cleric of good, who is drawn to \NPC{Raistlin} as a moth is drawn to flame. The other is his twin, \NPC{Caramon}, who must come to an understanding of himself before he can redeem his brother.

Together with the irrepressible \Monster{kender}, \NPC{Tasslehoff}, these three take a perilous journey back in time to the days just before the \Event{Cataclysm}.

In the doomed city of \Place{Istar}, poised on the brink of disaster, dark magic and darker ambition battle love and self-sacrifice in a quest to save not only the world but more importantly --- a soul.";

  "Many years ago, Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman told the story of how the \Group{Companions of the Lance} fought to save the world from sliding into darkness, fought to restore the fragile balance of good and evil.

The war was won. Peace cam to \Place{Krynn}. The \Group{Companions of the Lance} become heroes. The river of time flowed on.

The heroes dreamed of finding safe harbor ion that swift-running river. But the balance of eternal power is ever shifting, ever changing. The \God{Queen of Darkness} was defeated, not destroyed. Her powers are strong; people are weak. The forget the lessons of the past or close their eyes to them. The river's waters grow more turbulent, dangerous.

It is not, however, the \Group{Heroes of the Lance} who will be forced to plunge into the raging river of coming war. Their time is past. Their stories are told. It is for them now to hand the future to those younger, stronger.

It is time to pass the sword --- or the staff --- to those who will become the \Group{Heroes of the Second Generation}. Or to those who will bring about its doom.";

  \NPC{Guerrand}'s name is invoked again -- as the cause of the disaster.

  \NPC{Bram DiThon}, \NPC{Guerrand}'s nephew, is more like his uncle than the
  family would care to admit. A skilled herbalist, \NPC{Bram} has unknowingly
  turned his skills toward magic. It is to \NPC{Bram} the villagers turn when
  the plague changes their eyes to onyx, their limbs to snakes, and their flesh
  to stone.

  Unable to stop the unexplainable deaths, \NPC{Bram} sets out to find his
  missing uncle. He learns that \NPC{Guerrand} is the High Defender of
  \Place{Bastion}, the last stronghold before the \Place{Lost Citadel}. But in
  finding him, \NPC{Bram} has unwittingly given an evil \Class{mage} -- once
  \NPC{Guerrand}'s friend, now his archenemy -- the key to destroy the three
  orders of sorcery.

  Joined by a young \Monster{kendermaid}, a \Monster{human} lad, and a devout,

  onslaught of \Monster{dryads}, \Monster{shadow wights}, and that rarest of
  all monsters, the dread \Monster{forest boojum}.

  Also, from the team of Margaret Weis and Don Perrin, the latest adventure of
  \NPC{Kang} and his wayward troop of \Monster{draconians}.

  In the proud tradition of the best-selling \Place{Dragonlance} anthologies,
  \Product{Heroes and Fools} promises a sometimes heroic -- sometimes foolish
  -- visit to the world of \Place{Krynn}.".

  Indestructible}, a \Item{Class C Submersible Deepswimmer}, departs
  \Place{Sancrist Isle} with a crew of twenty and a callous disregard for the

  Armed with top-secret devices, a band of intrepid \Monster{gnome} explorers

  This is their story---and the story of a single member of that ignoble crew:
  \NPC{Conundrum}, the heroic \Monster{gnome} featured in Margaret Weis and
  Tracy Hickman's best-selling \Product{War of Souls} trilogy.".

  This is the second tale of \NPC{Sir Pirvan the Wayward}, whose reluctant and

  "Years have passed since the end of the \Event{War of the Lance}. The people
  of \Place{Ansalon} have rebuilt their lives, their houses, their

  homes, raising children and putting the days of their heroic deeds behind
  them.

  But peace on \Place{Krynn} comes at a price. The forces of darkness are ever
  vigilant, searching for ways to erode the balance of power and take
  control. When subtle changes begin to permeate the fragile peace, new lives
  are drawn into the web of fate woven around all the races. The time has come
  to pass the sword -- or the staff -- to the children of the Lance.

  They are the Second Generation.

  An all-new repackaged paperback edition of a classic \Place{Dragonlance}

  "Summer has come to \Place{Krynn}, a summer unlike any before. The sun bears
  down on land and sea, searing the world with relentless light and
  heat. Clouds and rain are nowhere to be found, and even the darkness of night
  brings little relief from the strange and oppressive day.

  Meanwhile, those who commune regularly with their gods are uneasy. Every day,
  their deities become more distant, more difficult to reach. Clerics' prayers
  go unanswered, and magic goes awry. As the tension on \Place{Ansalon} builds,
  estranged cousins \NPC{Palin Majere} and \NPC{Steel Brightblade} search for
  an explanation. It soon becomes evident that more than just magic is at
  stake.

  The fate of all \Place{Krynn} hangs in the balance.

  Weis and Tracy Hickman's first hardcover New York Times bestseller. It is the

  Worth the price of a soul?

  \NPC{Dhamon Grimwulf} and his band of mercenaries greedily eye a
  long-forgotten treasure concealed beneath a grassy plain. Legends promise
  riches too numerous to count, wealth too grand to be believed. But in a
  shifting world of secrets and deception, such fortune comes at a high price,
  higher even than the searing agony \NPC{Dhamon} suffers under the curse of a
  \Monster{dragon}'s scale.

  High enough to cost \NPC{Dhamon} his life.

  'Jean Rabe's characters and stories are a wonderful addition to the saga of
  \Place{Krynn}.'
  \right{-- Margaret Weis}

  The paperback version of the sequel to \Product{Downfall}, the first book of
  the \Product{Dhamon Saga}. Betrayal continues the adventures of characters

  the common folk, and the once-proud \Group{Elven Senate} moves at the will of
  the \Monster{green dragon} \NPC{Beryl}. Even the \Monster{elf} king walks a
  tightrope betweena serving the needs of his people and keeping the
  \Monster{dragon}'s knights peaceful.

  Out of these mired politics a mysterious heroine arises, a \Group{Kagonesti}
  woman of the forest glades and rocky eastern reaches. She and her loyal band
  of resistance fighters swiftly become the terror of the \Group{Dark
  Knights}. Known to friend and foe as \NPC{The Lioness}, she is the champion
  of the people who have been bled by the \Monster{dragon}'s taxes and ground
  under the steel-shod boots of the hostile knights.

  She is \NPC{Kerianseray}, the king's own outlaw, his secret lover, and his
  secret weapon.";

  "Lifelong friends, they went their separate ways. Now they are together
  again, though each holds secrets from the others in his heart. They speak of
  a world shadowed with rumors of war. They speak of tales of strange monsters,
  creatures of myth, creatures of legend. They do not speak of their
  secrets. Not then. Not until a chance encounter with a beautiful, sorrowful
  woman, who bears a magical crystal staff, draws the companions deeper into
  the shadows, forever changing their lives and shaping the fate of the world.

  No one expects them to be heroes.

  The title that started the entire \Place{Dragonlance} phenomenon is now being
  released in a trade hardcover edition for the first time in its publishing
  history. Featuring the stunning art and design that graced the cover of the
  paperback edition, this title is the first in a series of hardcover releases
  of all of the core \Place{Dragonlance} titles by Weis & Hickman. Fans and
  collectors alike now have the chance to obtain the entire set of core titles
  in hardcover.".

  "Now the people know that the \Monster{dragon} minions of \God{Takhisis},
  \God{Queen of Dragons}, have returned. The people of all nations prepare to
  fight to save their homes, their lives, and their freedom. But the races have
  long been divided by hatred and prejudice. \Monster{Elven} warriors and
  \Monster{human} knights fight among themselves. It seems the battle has been
  lost before it begins.

  \Group{The companions} are separated, torn apart by war. A full season will
  pass before they meet again--if they meet again. As the darkness deepens, a
  disgraced knight, a pampered \Monster{elf}maiden, and a rattle-brained
  \Monster{kender} stand alone in the pale winter sunlight.

  Not much in the way of heroes.".

  \right{-- \NPC{The Calantina}, IX:IX}

  Weasel's luck was not always good.

  \NPC{Galen Pathwarden}, known unaffectionately as 'the Weasel', would give
  anything to stay clear of adventure, danger, or heroism.

  But that is before young \NPC{Galen} is pitch-forked into the center of a

  tournament unto death.

  Together, \NPC{Galen}, the great \Group{Solamnic Knight}, \NPC{Sir Bayard
  Brightblade}, and a non-too-bright \Monster{centaur} \NPC{Agion} must
  overcome the schemes and traps of a sinister illusionist known only as the

  Deep beneath the mountain fortress of \Place{Skullcap}, legend has it, are
  the remains of the dark wizard \NPC{Fistandantilus} and the path to the gates
  of the \Monster{dwarven} kingdom of \Place{Thorbardin}. Buried somewhere

  \Item{Grallen's helm}, it is prophesized, will be rewarded and honored by a
  united \Place{Thorbardin} -- but he will also open the gates of the realm to
  fresh horror and chaos.

  In \Place{The Gates of Thorbardin}, Dan Parkinson, author of
  \Place{Starsong}, continues the history of the \Monster{dwarves} of
  \Place{Krynn} in the tradition of Nancy Varian Berberick's best-selling
