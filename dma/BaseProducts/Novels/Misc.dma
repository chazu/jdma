Eldritch constructs bent to the service of godlike wizards. From four worlds of magic and mystery, one monster rises above all others to threaten death, offer hope, spread fear, or horde treasure. No matter what the world, only a \Monster{dragon} can set it, and the imaginations of millions, afire. Four of the most exciting shared worlds in the history of fantasy come together for the first time in one volume, drawn together at last by the mighty dragons of myth and legend.";

  description       "Between a desert and a dried-up sea lies the town of \Place{Watering Hole}, the only oasis for miles and the home of our intrepid heroes, \NCP{Shaani} and {Xoota}. After some rather harrowing adventures in the desert, they are followed home by a swarm of empathic \Monster{earwigs}. As if a psychic bug infestation weren\'t enough, the town\'s water supply has suddenly turned into a trick of brackish sludge.
                    Theorizing that the water comes from beyond the desert, \NPC{Shaani} and \NPC{Xoota} propose an expedition to find the source. Crossing the desert has never been done --- and with water in short supply, the task seems impossible. But when the Uberhuman \NPC{Benek}, and his love of cryogenically frozen brides, enter\'s the picture, what follows is an adventure for the ages.";
