  "\large{'Where's our treasure-moving thingie?'

  'You mean \NPC{Nodwick}?' 'Yeat, that.'}

  That pretty much sums up life for the legendary henchman, \NPC{Nodwick}. You
  hold in your hands the first volume of his hilarious adventures with three of
  the world's most unprofessional heroes. \emph{Thrill} to his being used as a
  grappling hook! \emph{Marvel} as he helps to thwart evil and gets no credit!
  \emph{Gasp} in awe that there's anything left of him for \NPC{Piffany the
  Cleric} to duct tape back together!

  This volume contains the first six issues of the uproariously funny (and
  slightly sadistic) Nodwick comic book by Aaron Williams. It's the story of
  the little guy, the temp worker, the person on the payroll with the title
  'sacrificial lamb'. Read on, and know that while your job may not be the
  best, there's little chance you'll be swallowed by a big, scaly monster... we
  \emph{hope}...".

  fantasy movie trilogy ever, and a fish story that'll make you wish you owned
  a horned helmet!

  \NPC{Nodwick} is the critically-acclaimed fantasy humor comic book that
  presents the adventures of the world's most favorite henchman as he toils for
  a somewhat inept (but well-meaning) bad of adventurers.".

  "96 pages of classic KODT including a brand new storiy!!

  Eight years ago the first \bold{Knights of the Dinner Table} strip was
  created as an afterthought - filler to take up space on the last page of the
  small press games publication I was putting out in my spare time.

  Since that time, \bold{KODT} has appeared in numerous magazines and is now a
  monthly comic book. It's been a strange and wonderful journey.

  When it came time to start pulling the first three issues together for a
  second printing, I found myself thinking back over that journey - from that
  first strip to the current issue of the comic book.

  KODT is a celebration, not a gaming, but of games themselves. For me the word
  'gamers' is synonymous with the word 'friends'. Perhaps that's why all those
  letters to the KODT mailbox start out with that same familiar phrase, 'These
  guys remind me of my friends'.

  Although J.R.R. Tolkien warned us not to 'ask to see the bones boiled to make
  the soup', I really don't think there would be any harm in asking that
  question regarding the soup that's come to be known as \Product{Knights of
  the Dinner Table}.

  The 'bones' here are obviously friends and all those things that forge
  lasting friendships; laughing, fighting, sharing, caring, etc...".

  "96 pages of classic KODT including a brand new story!!

  The moment I leafed through the first few issues that Jolly produced prior to
  teaming up with us, I knew they were something special. When he became a
  partner in Kenzer and Company, we really believed in the power of the strips
  but were uncertain whether or not the rest of the gaming community would
  catch on. At this point I think we can safely say that our faith in those
  early Kenzer and Company produced issues [#4-#6] has paid off.

  We really put a lot of thought into those first few issues as we felt we had
  something to prove as a new team. While Jolly had the bulk of the issue #4
  done before joining us, many of the stories in issues #5 and #6 involved some
  synergistic collaboration by the newly formed development team. There are
  definitely some classic strips among issues four through six. Of course
  there's the famous 'Agent of Evil' but looking back over them I can't help
  feeling like 'Wherever you go - There you are' is the one nearest to my
  heart. I was often the mapper of the group.

  As you read this, I'm sure you'll find your own favorite stories based on one
  of your personal experiences. That's what KODT is all about; bringing back
  the memories of good times past and making new ones. Here's to making new
  ones.

  "Long long time ago, when I was a young child in front of the fire, in the
  cold starry, desert night... I remember being told about an ancient
  prophecy.

  It talked about our own people, the people of \Group{Ma'atar}, who in those
  times where endangered by the shadow of \Monster{Phaerimm}, who settled along
  the border of our land, hidden in the \Place{Spellguard Ruins}. It talked
  about strangers that came from far away, whose destiny was tied to ours and
  about how they fought against a terrible and forbidden menace.

  The tribe will be decimated by the powerful forces of something that couldn't
  be stopped and the leading people will die. Only one, the spirit of the
  freedom of the tribe, will survive and will lead the people of
  \Place{Anauroch} to new glory in the path of the Gods.

  By maybe I'm wrong. All this was not a prophecy but a legend, and those
  heroes became immortals by creating their own histories.

  That's the story as it was told to me by the father of my father, and that
  now I will tell you, and you will tell it to your children, and the children
  or your children.".

  \NPC{Drizzt Do'Urden} has abandoned his people and their corrupt
  society. Alone amon the \Monster{Drow}, this young warrior thirsts for
  justice and friendship, rather than power and violence --- and knows his only
  hope for finding them lays in the labyrinthine tunnels of the

  --- and rather than finding a higher calling, \NPC{Drizzt} has discovered
  only crushing loneliness and an unending series of hostile enemies.

  Throughout the decade \NPC{Drizzt} has wandered the subterranean wilderness,
  his ruthless family has remained at war. With her House's fortunes rapidly
  waning, the evil \NPC{Matron Malice Do'Urden} has become obsessed with the
  idea that her renegade son is the key to the family's return to power. To
  hunt him down, \NPC{Malice} will dispatch a hunter who is capable not only of

  "He left behind everything and everyone he knew --- all in the pursuit of
  justice. Like others of his race, \NPC{Drizzt Do'Urden} was raised in the
  endless night of the subterranean \Place{Underdark}. But where other
  \Monster{dark elves} seek power, \NPC{Drizzt} seeks justice. Those whom
  they'd oppress, \NPC{Drizzt} wishes to befriend. Unwilling to submit to the
  violence and wickedness of his people, the young warrior abandoned his
  childhood home.

  Journey to a new world. Realizing he'd never truly be beyond the reach of his
  people as long as he remained underground, \NPC{Drizzt} determined to do what
  no other of his kind had done: leave the shadows of the \Place{Underdark} for
  the blazing sun of the surface.

  An outcast in search of a home. Now, he has begun a sojourn through a world
  utterly unlike his own. But acceptance among the surface-dwellers will not
  come easily --- nor without sacrifice...";

Soon moving to other venues, comic books, and web sites, \Product{Dork Tower} became one of the longest-running, most critically-acclaimed and (most importantly) geekiest gaming comic strips out there. \Product[DSP 216]{Dork Decade} collects every comic strip from \Product{Shadis} and \Product{Dragon} magazines of the strip's first decade, chronologically and in color for the first time, along with notes, sketches and much more. Give in to the Dork size! HUZZAH!".
