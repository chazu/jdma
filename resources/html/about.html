<p><em>
Ixitxachitl are a race of intelligent, aquatic beings that resemble small
manta rays with barbed tails. They have an evil disposition and worship evil
powers; they love to hunt marine humanoids, and then sacrifice or devour their
catch.  Ixitxachitl is both singular and plural; it is properly pronounced
ish-it-SHACH-itl, though many refer to them as icks-it-ZACH-it-ul or even
icks-it-zuh-chit-ul.

<p>
Ixitixachitls is also the name of our D&D group. We are more or less regularly
playing D&D since 1993 and since about that time work in the Dungeon Master
Assistant started. It first started as a C/C++ project but unfortunately we had
to restart everything after a severe harddisk crash, of course without really
useful backups.
</p>

<p>
After some time without continuation of the project we finally decided to
restart the project, this time using Java as the programming language. For this
reason the tool was also renamed to jDMA.
