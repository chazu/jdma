title:DMA - Dungeon Master Assistant

<h1>DMA - Dungeon Master Assistant</h1>

The Dungeon Master Assitant is intended to help Dungeon Masters and Players
prepare and keep track of their Dungeons & Dragons 3.5 game. The tool is still
in development and thus only covers a fraction of its intended
possibilities. It currently only covers preliminary management for products and
items.

You can start looking at some information by clicking on the <div class="sprite
library"></div> <a href="/library/" onclick="util.link(event,
'/library')">library</a> icon on the top right. There you can also log in using
the <div class="sprite login"></div> login icon, if you have an account
here. An account allows you to change your entries and manmage your characters.

DMA runs on Java 6 and provides own web server, giving access to all its
information through its web interface. The data itself is stored in a set
of <code>.dma</code> files, human readable text files containing all
information.

<p>
All data is stored in entities in two main categories, namely base entries and
entries. As the name implies, base entries are the base value and they
represent information that is static throughout one or even several
campaigns. On the other hand, entries represent actual objects used in a
game.<br />

For example, the base entry for a long sword contains all the game information
for a typical long sword (damage, value, weight, etc.). On the other hand, the
long sword entry contains information about a specific long sword wielded by a
character in a campaign. Thus, while there may be only one base long sword,
there might be multiple long sword, which all derive their base values from the
base entry.<br/>
